Review
"While Nolan brings the full weight of his filmmaking talent to bear on the film, it is actually the performances that stand out the most."
I was uncomfortable watching yet another film about tortured white male genius when the victims of the atrocities glossed over by Oppenheimer had no voice.
"Nuclear noir spectator sports, a poison apple metaphorically intimating apocalyptic original sin, bombs, bombshells, and that buried Operation Paper Clip elephant in the room. "
"Nolan blows up the traditional biopic and rebuilds it in thrilling, dynamic fashion."
"Oppenheimer is arguably one of the best films of the year, and it wouldn't be surprising if it didn't get at least a few Oscar nominations."
A suitably sobering drama that largely hangs under a mushroom cloud of darkly troubling sociopolitical issues.
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer stands not only as one of the very best films of the year, but also one of the finest accomplishments of his remarkable career."
"An intense, inventively filmed, and well-acted biopicture about the kinds of events that are hard on the heart.
"
"With pitch-perfect contributions by Nolan’s previous collaborators on the craft team and some newcomers, every inch of every image feels meticulous."
"In a movie about impending global catastrophe, he gives a close-up of a face, and a twitch of a lip the power of an atom bomb."
Oppenheimer is the most important story of our time.
"What he [Nolan] has put before our eyes definitively deserves to be seen, as does Cillian Murphy's performance in the role of Oppenheimer and the irreconcilable but fantastic Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Lewis Strauss. [Full review in Spanish]"
"His latest effort is too much of an endurance test, a magnum opus consumed by its quest for significance..."
A cinematographic marvel by all measures. [Full review in Spanish]
"The explosion of the test bomb is a bravura dance of imagery and sound, but also lack of sound. It’s an understanding of power without any of the essential characters in that moment knowing precisely what’s to come."
"Oppenheimer is mythic, massive, and a masterful work from Christopher Nolan. Murphy & Downey Jr. deliver career best performances in what is the most important movie of the decade."
Oppenheimer is a flawed genius who can grapple with the intricacies of quantum mechanics but can’t resolve the moral dilemmas that plague his public and private lives. 
"[Christopher Nolan's] most stirring plea to humanity yet. A three-hour drama that plays like a terse thriller, weaving Nolan’s deep-seated fears for the survival of our species through a biography of one of its most significant and controversial figures."
"Armed with a haunting Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan gives us his most personal and political film yet, that is fascinating as it is flawed."
"Oppenheimer is sombre and electrifying, dizzying and bloated, a contradiction that never quite comes together but at the same time is one of Nolan’s best and most political works to date. "
"The true test of 'Oppenheimer' is whether Nolan can maintain his typically mammoth vision with a narrative that mostly comprises white men talking in small rooms. Like his protagonist, he succeeds in a grand and unexpectedly horrifying fashion."
"Though the entire ensemble operates as a well-oiled machine, it feels like distracting stunt casting at times."
"A cinematographic masterpiece... of the highest level, as well as an organized sensorial experience that gives us back a historical event that is relevant in the present and also transcendental. [Full review in Spanish]"
"After three hours of viewing, you will understand Oppenheimer's  drive for success--I can highly recommend the film as you’ll learn a wealth of information while being artfully entertained."
"Oppenheimer is a long film, but it never causes a sense of ennui. The subjects are both intriguing and terrifying as Nolan warns against nuclear possibilities and character assassination."
"It is a noble try, an interesting experience, and an absolutely fascinating example of the director as superstar."
"It is the most exhilarating and harrowing story about scientists I’ve seen in a minute, with a cast of staggering renown bringing the story to life."
"With human paradoxes at its nucleus, this is a riveting portrait, both intimate and epic, of the self-involved men who think they make the world go round... and too often, tragically, do."
"Cillian Murphy did a fantastic job with his portrayal of Dr. Oppenheimer! Not only did he resemble Dr. Oppenheimer, he was able to capture all of the fear and torment with his facial expression alone! Christopher Nolan truly brought filmmaking up a notch!"
"""Oppenheimer"" is a stunner and one more way director Christopher Nolan reminds us cinema is a vital art form, not a disposable one."
"I find the last third of this movie to be interesting, and the first two-thirds to be long and, at times, not understandable."
"It's a huge film, designed to be watched in IMAX (as I did) but it's actually a very intimate tale: arguably the first character study that Nolan has ever done."
"The three-hour running time and scientific jargon demand patience, but Nolan's marriage of visuals and sound design is often dazzling, not least during the tension-filled detonation of the prototype device. "
"Thankfully, despite my qualms with Nolan purposefully structuring things to exploit our belief he's finally told a straightforward story, I was still completely taken by its gravitas. Give Murphy and Downey Jr. Oscars."
"The way the director approaches Oppenheimer's fears and his internal struggles with surrealistic images is the most admirable aspect of the film, and leaved us wanting to see more about it. [Full review in Spanish]"
OPPENHEIMER is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus. An engrossing epic that brings you inside the tortured mind of a man driven to change the world. Cillian Murphy is quietly stunning as the consumed Oppenheimer and RDJ delivers an Oscar worthy performance.
"This is very clear, effective, disciplined prestige filmmaking, enough to make this one of the toniest pieces of Oscarbait that I expect to see this year - but it is Oscarbait."
"Nolan refrains from passing judgment on Oppenheimer – leaving that to us, if we so choose – suggesting instead that it’s within our inherently contradictory human nature to create as well as destroy."
"The supporting cast are astonishing, particularly Downey Jr, who is on career best form as Strauss – his Best Supporting Actor nomination is surely already in the bag. "
"This movie resembles a nightmare that torments not only the protagonist, but all of humanity. A horror that still lives and that finds a perfect representation in Cillian Murphy's haunted eyes. [Full review in Portuguese]"
"An intellectual thriller that is a masterpiece of image and word, of complex ideas made manifest, and all kept at a very human level to maintain constant immediacy."
"One of the most stirring things about this excellently dense and jumpy biopic is that Nolan never tries to reconcile his subjects’ contradictions. If anything, he realises the futility of trying to know the unknowable. Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer?"
"The momentum the film generates due to the chronological cross-cutting becomes relentless, and that runaway feeling is beautifully harmonious with the film’s broader interest in Oppenheimer’s legacy."
...a technically-impressive yet mostly underwhelming drama...
"As emotional, beautiful, and thought-provoking as this film is, it’s that much more powerful because it’s based on historical events. It’s a film I won’t be able to shake for a long time."
"Rarely have I left a movie feeling smarter than when I went in, but “Oppenheimer” is just such a film and it elevated my thinking, especially in regards to the science of politics and the politics of science."
"The film’s sheer density and a revolving door of characters make it heavy, but more often than not, Nolan’s filmmaking soars. "
"The film’s speed – necessary to crunch decades of history into a condensed character study – is a bit like a trick in itself, both neglecting to let us dwell in a moment while emphasizing that Oppenheimer himself rarely did."
"Nolan and his entire crafts team have made something extraordinary. If the question is can a movie about a historical event be thrilling and suspenseful, Oppenheimer makes the answer a resounding ""yes."""
"A majestic, mournful entertainment that’s as serious as a heart attack, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s bullseye shot at Grand Statement cinema that’s about nothing less than human annihilation."
"This is a big, mammoth movie, boasting a career-best performance from Cillian Murphy, a whip-smart script, and other technical marvels. Jennifer Lame's editing is particularly remarkable."
"Fortunately, it’s not treated like a dense physics course that can be overwhelming and difficult to understand. This film is one of Nolan’s best and searingly simple-yet-complicated works. "
"A studious examination of history, shown via a reverent lens of Hollywood spectacle, Oppenheimer is a chilling biopic that could be Christopher Nolan’s best picture yet."
"This is a complex look at a complicated man, but Oppenheimer unequivocally establishes that this is a story worth telling -- and that Nolan was the perfect filmmaker to do it. "
"If Dunkirk, [Christopher Nolan's] 2017 film about the historic World War II battle, was his bid to prove that he’s a “serious filmmaker”, then Oppenheimer proves that he should be considered one of the modern masters of cinema."
"Every scene feels like a cataclysm waiting to happen, fitting for a film that builds, step-by-step, to the creation of a cataclysm machine. Oppenheimer both summons awe for what it took to build the bomb and for the changes it wrought. "
"A messy, sprawling, operatic statement from Nolan. It’s technically masterful, but can also keep you at a distance during crucial moments. But it’s also incredibly exciting to behold, a mosaic of intellectual cinema drenched onto the screen. "
"On one side it’s an opportunity to get a history lesson on the matter, but the film only really shines on a few scattered powerful moments. It all came up more informative than fun."
"In a year that has given us several great films, this one shines above the rest and is the strongest contender for the Oscar so far in 2023."
"As he corrals the world’s scientists to follow behind him Robert Oppenheimer is magnetic, more akin to a cult leader than a lowly whitecoat."
"At three hours, Oppenheimer as a whole falls short of the sum of its pleasing parts."
"There’s one element worthy of unreserved praise here, and that’s Robert Downey Jr.’s welcome-home performance — his comeback, if you will, from his comeback, which kidnapped him into Marvel movies for eleven years"
"So much of our lives is about the fear and fearlessness around turning theory into action, at all levels of our lives. Oppenheimer is a run with those bulls, fearless and relentless."
"Despite a few minor problems, Nolan has shown that with great patience comes great power. It may take some time but eventually Nolan shows his latest work is a blinding light of creativity."
"Oppenheimer is on the cusp of changing the world, mostly for the worst, but barely focuses on the moral quandary of this. All the Nolan beats but were missing the snarky Sorkin dialogue of A Few Good Men and smooth Tarantino style of Inglourious Basterds."
"[Nolan] captures that theoretical aspect of Oppenheimer on the screen in very personal moments... that energy, that swirl of passion in the unknown it's all there, and it is phenomenal to watch. "
"If it does nothing else, this movie reminds us that the world still sits on the brink of global thermonuclear war, and international political and military leaders have repeatedly demonstrated they are no wiser today than world leaders were 78 years ago."
"Oppenheimer leaves you in tatters as it is a gripping piece on a man consumed by guilt and inner turmoil. “A man who became death, the destroyer of worlds.” You won't forget this film for a long time."
This film is a White-Jewish male compartmentalized view of history that blinds us to the truth of the world that J. Robert Oppenheimer worked in. 
"Christopher Nolan’s epic film bio/thriller is so gripping that you feel like you’re right there with Oppenheimer, anticipating the possible horrors his creation might unleash – never mind the horrors it did unleash."
"I am Nolan, saviour of cinema. Look upon my works, ye audiences, and despair. For what it is, it works, but it’s so boring when a man can demand so much to facilitate his achievement and still think he did it alone."
The easy part for Christopher Nolan was making Oppenheimer a big-screen behemoth...trickier was embedding within that blockbuster a film of almost excruciating intimacy; a psychodrama that probes the soul of the 20th century’s most unknowable man.
'Oppenheimer' is a masterpiece.
"The narrative of Oppenheimer's life certainly holds more than ample fascination for even a film with a three-hour runtime, and the story is treated comprehensively, with care and depth."
"Intellectually engaging, visually and sonically stimulating, and packing an emotional wallop."
"Christopher Nolan’s newest film is jarring and memorable, an ode to creation and consequence."
"Oppenheimer ignores the darker sides of the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer in order to deliver a crowd-pleasing, blockbuster spectacle."
"Fascinating and frustrating, too close and aloof, this anti-biopic is a winning fusion of explosive paradoxes."
"Not only does Oppenheimer prove to be one the best-crafted biopics in recent memory, but it also boldly reaffirms the director’s auteur status."
"Everything about Christopher Nolan’s latest movie is massive. The level of shock and awe is breathtaking, but it can also be taxing."
The paradoxical thrill of Oppenheimer is that Nolan crafts an epic tale that’s intimate in nature—daring to go small when everyone is expecting a grand display of showmanship.
Oppenheimer should have been called Oppie. And the shorting of the film's name should have been accompanied by an equally dramatic shorting of the film itself.
"A rare film that deserves its hype, Oppenheimer stands tall as a biopic that presents complex and conflicting matters in a clearly understandable manner."
I was compelled throughout.
"Employing the stark angles of star Cillian Murphy’s expressive mien to great effect, Nolan gets into the head of the physicist, husband, father, womanizer, de facto politician, national hero, accused spy, and bomb-builder whose work changed the world."
"The visuals and technical aspects of Oppenheimer were always going to inspire praise, but it's Nolan's look at our frailty that sets this film in the upper echelon of an already famed filmography."
"Nolan’s name comes with a level of prestige, and he doesn’t disappoint. The sound, score, cinematography, acting and overall execution are immaculate."
"Befitting his paradigm-shattering protagonist, Nolan so audaciously merges form and content that he completely upends the ‘great-man’ biopic. "
It's the film Christopher Nolan was born to direct. 
"“Oppenheimer” is sensationally filmed. The performances are mostly great, provided the role is a dude. It is easy to see why so many people are praising what’s here. But it is stealth stupid. It is sneaky simplistic. It is camouflaged dumb."
"Admittedly complicated and confusing, Christopher Nolan's non-linear bio-pic is intense, exacting and explosive. Expect Oscar nods for Nolan, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr., who deliver the most indelible performances of their respective careers."
"Oppenheimer is a serious and appropriately disturbing film about nuclear weapons and nuclear war. It is intended to leave viewers shaken, and it succeeds in that."
"OPPENHEIMER is Christopher Nolan at his most operatic, his most ethereal, and his most horrific. "
An absolute achievement in spectacle and Swiss-watch storytelling. 
"Oppenheimer is about genius, about a man, about a bomb, but it’s also about the waste laid to the world by weak men."
"You may know the story of the “Father of the Atomic Bomb” but experiencing his life and work through Nolan’s lens is a thrilling, captivating treat."
A directing high-point for the already acclaimed Christopher Nolan. Top-notch performances and a truly riveting tale of what is unfortunately our history. Not a very rewatchable movie and I really wish I would cease to have audio issues with Nolan films.
Played with unwavering solidity by Cillian Murphy...
"Starring Cillian Murphy, and his cheekbones, the film is dense, ambitious, complex, so very long (three hours) and impressive, even if it does drag by the end. "
"Like J. Robert Oppenheimer, Nolan is a genius -- and, also like Oppenheimer, he may be too close to his subject matter to realize that he lost the thread. "
Top Gun: Maverick is the reason why I go to the movies and why Tom Cruise is the biggest movie star in the world. WHAT. A RIDE. 
"Maverick dished out generous amounts of bromance, action, and a truly-immersive narrative in swashbuckling style, and Cruise’s iconic grin was still the greatest thing to take away from it."
It is all of the flying sequences that are shot in such a way that it makes the moviegoer feel like they are a passenger that gives the movie its energy and makes it so much fun.
"Top Gun: Maverick is a surprising stunner crafted with pure adrenaline and kerosene.
"
Tom Cruise might save cinema.
"SPECTACULAR! One of the best cinematic experiences I have truly ever had in a theater. Heartfelt, exhilarating & down right emotional. Tom Cruise turns in one of his best performances & Top Gun 2 becomes one of his best films in his Career."
"The return of pure, nostalgic blockbusters. The best aerial action sequences ever amaze even the highest expectations, not only due to the absolutely insane real stunts but largely because of the flawless contribution of all filmmaking elements."
"The final scenes are truly nail biting, with intense flight sequences that result in Tom Cruise’s cast members going from nearly unknown performers, to A-list stars in a matter of minutes."
"Top Gun: Maverick is the rare sequel that elevates its source material and creates a new, worthwhile story. A high-octane thrill ride that celebrates where Maverick's been and where he’s going."
"The film is pure ideology, pure militarism, generic, and like the first Top Gun in 1986, undemanding."
"Women in Top Gun: Maverick don’t see much development, but written dialogue and camerawork treat them with respect."
"There’s no reason in the world it should have worked, but it does. "
"A movie-movie with an old-school movie star, this actioner is best seen in theatres, where the dazzling fighter-jet sequences will make you dizzy."
All of these elements come together to form one of the biggest third acts in recent cinema. 
"While other actors disappear behind their roles, Tom Cruise wants you to know it's him. This movie uses all of its technical marvel to bring us back to an adrenaline-filled formula blockbuster full of emotion. Made for the movies. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Top Gun: Maverick is a little bloated at times and could have used a bit of trimming, especially in its third act, but there’s no denying the magnetic energy the film brings to the viewer."
"""It’s a valid critical interpretation that Top Gun: Maverick is merely propaganda wrapped in a very pretty bow. But boy, that bow is really something."""
Its a sure-footed performance from an actor that never fails to hold the attention of its audience.
A big jingoistic cartoon. But it’s a fun jingoistic cartoon...
"After years of uncertainty with the pandemic, Tom Cruise's Top Gun: Maverick has saved movie theaters, revitalizing their business with a great film."
"We want the thrill of suspense, to root for characters, to be in awe of cinematography, and to share the collective experience of unity in watching a film with strangers.This movie gives you that and more!"
"Stunning aerial action sequences aren't just random dogfighting but serve as narrative test runs to prep viewers for the climax. Granted, the nostalgia wouldn’t exist without Tony Scott, so it’s hard to give Kosinski credit for copying the flight pattern."
"As the movie star system gives way to the IP era, don’t ever forget one thing: Tom Cruise is still a major movie star."
Burnished 1980s blockbuster nostalgia as Tom Cruise and producer Jerry Bruckheimer prove they can still make ’em like they used to. Strap in for the thrillingly real aerial dog fights.
"The zenith of modern “legacy sequels,” Top Gun: Maverick is in many ways traditional—from its “rah rah” militarism, to its 1980s individualism—but it’s also a metatextual lament for the dying light of movie stars."
Visually and emotionally satisfying in ways that you’d think would be the norm for big movies featuring families and explosions but very much aren’t.
"… an astonishing and glorious film that far surpassing its mediocre predecessor with a good story, amazing tech credits and some fab performances beginning with Cruise himself, who deserves to be in the Oscar conversation"
Top Gun: Maverick will take your breath away! 
"So, why did Top Gun: Maverick strike such a cord with audiences? It’s a film about feeling relevant. About a changing world. Parenthood. Friendship. It resonates. "
"It contains just as many formulaic narrative sops and expected character beats as the original, but the streamlining of the simple storyline provides a breeziness that befits and benefits the picture."
"""Top Gun: Maverick"" delivers on just about every level imaginable and then exceeds it: plus ultra."
...a decent-enough sequel that ultimately falls right in line with its watchable yet far-from-flawless predecessor...
"If a more cheesy sensibility is what you are looking for, then you'll likely enjoy the hell out of this film. "
"Like its predecessor, it thrives on military fetishism, a**hole energy, and the suspension of belief usually reserved for latter-day Liam Neeson fight scenes. "
"One more piece of advice: See it in a theater. A big, loud, and crowded one. See it with the fans. That's the way these summer blockbuster blasts were designed to work."
Cruise delivers a nuanced performance that gives Maverick multitudes. More than the character deserves. They find a way to make this guy likable and that is an achievement in itself...
"Top Gun: Maverick represents the best of what blockbuster filmmaking can be, brilliantly blending spectacle with sentiment to exhilarating effect."
A good story made for young and no so young. It will bring to the beloved franchise a whole new herd of followers. A splurge of technology and action without equal. [Full review in Spanish]
"After Cruise and McQuarrie perfected the action thriller with Mission: Impossible—Fallout (2018), now they’re back (along with [director Joseph Kosinski and] some other screenwriters and story originators) to perfect the hero’s farewell."
"It flies higher than the original with a few aerial sequences that demonstrate Cruise's skill at piloting anything, but I don't find the sense of adrenaline in the flight routines and the predictable missions in the danger zone. [Full review in Spanish]"
"... A summer blockbuster of the old school, with rust-bucket F-14s duking it out with young pups in F-18s, all shot on celluloid rather than sketched in by computers, at the behest of a star who refuses to quit. "
"Maverick may make you cry at points, but it is a feel-good, crowd-pleaser through and through."
"The screenplay impeccably balances the new with the nostalgic, drafting on the previous movie’s conflicts and amplifying its emotions."
It shines brightest in the final 30 minutes which features some of the best aerial fighter footage ever put on screen. See it in the theater. You won’t regret it.
"Sights, sounds and speed act as a unifying force in an assault on our senses. When the engine roars, our knees tremble. When the jets dive, swoop and pirouette like they were in a musical number, the adrenaline rush trickles into the rest of the body. "
"Brings Maverick’s story full circle in a satisfying manner that adds depth and dimension to its predecessor, but still tells a story that’s all its own."
Forced ode to the original doesn't fully embrace the cheese
A sequel that manages to soar higher than it's predecessor. 
"One of the rare films where every discussion leaving the theater is about how much fun you just had, instead of an analysis of its quotients."
Top Gun: Maverick repositions Tom Cruise as the world’s biggest movie star in his reprisal of a role that he invests with wisdom and experience without losing that hotshot confidence.
"When Maverick is called back to tutor the most elite young Top Gun graduates for an impossible mission, one can imagine Cruise — by starring in a sequel 36 years after the cult original — schooling the next generation about true-blue action cinema."
"There's so much great action, incredible stunts, big laughs, and emotional moments that really send the viewer on a journey, which is exactly why we go to the movies."
Kilmer’s inclusion in the blockbuster sequel shows that the franchise’s primary rivals are affected by something much stronger than g-forces these days: time.
"It helps that the filmmaking is pretty much impeccable, with director Joseph Kosinski providing the kind of clear, streamlined action sequences that make blockbuster spectacle feel fun instead of mandatory."
"In Top Gun: Maverick, Cruise has his patented charm, energy, and credibility."
"Gorgeous cinematography, insane flying action sequences, thrilling, emotionally moving, and a sequel that absolutely surpasses its predecessor. Well-paced, executed & has that re-watchability factor.  "
"Along comes a film like Top Gun: Maverick (a film which the release was delayed a couple of times) and it reminds us of the good ole days in several ways. Thank you Joseph Kosinski (Oblivion, Spiderhead) and even bigger props to the ageless Tom Cruise."
"As much fun as it is when a familiar formula is well-executed, this movie is also an altar to America's obsession with youthfulness, its exaltation of white super-men, its worship of heavy artillery ... and (sigh) its objectification of women as trophies."
Maverick’s fidelity to the past goes deeper than dollar signs. This is a film where generational commitments matter and institutional continuity is valued.
"The film is lovingly dedicated to the late Tony Scott, who directed “Top Gun.”  I’d like to think that he would give a thumbs up and a salute to “Top Gun: Maverick.”"
"Top Gun: Maverick is not bloated fan service, and it hits you with the right amount of nostalgia. A thrilling summer blockbuster!"
"""A perfect popcorn movie and an improvement on the original."" "
"An action movie that's this visibly wondrous and entertaining, knows it's walking in familiar footsteps but puts in a bold effort to make this return trip mean something is electrifying and, yes, breathtaking.
"
"As someone who typically hates sequels, this is by far one of the best ones ever made. It pays homage to the original and elevates everything!"
This was a very entertaining two hours that I might have enjoyed more than the original. 
"""Top Gun: Maverick"" pulls out all the stops to make this moviegoing experience an absolute spectacle."
"Armed with a squadron of F-18s, compact digital cameras, and a wild disregard for Tom Cruise’s personal safety, Maverick’s aerial sequences are the most spectacular ever filmed. "
"bears some residual traces of its predecessor, but it also shines in its own right, bringing to its title character a surprisingly effective sense of gravitas and emotional endurance"
"Joe Kosinski matches his well-established architectural precision with suitably nostalgic but never pandering emotionality, while Cruise commands the screen in a performance that leverages his multimillion-dollar star wattage to brighten the entire film."
"It's wild what a plot can do. Where Top Gun succeeded on vibes alone, Maverick understands that the reason for getting all these characters together needs enough substance to sustain our interest in them as people."
Top Gun Maverick is cinematic in every way. It’s a gift to traditional filmmaking and meant for the biggest screen possible. One of Tom Cruise's strongest films.
An impressive action sequel that stays away from everything other than pure escapism. And that's great!
"Joseph Kosinski and his team have umbraced the plot cliché thats put face to face past and present, turning it into a narrative engine that makes take off what we could describe as the perfect blockbuster."
Top Gun: Maverick is a mature blockbuster and an improvement over its predecessor.
For about two thirds of its runtime Top Gun Maverick feels like a rehash of the original film. But the action pieces in the final act along with Cruise's steady leadership turn it into a breed of blockbuster we don't crome across that often nowadays.
The Top Gun sequel delivers action and emotions driven by a whole lot of nostalgia.
Practically a beat-for-beat remake of the original with a non-existent screenplay that has so little interest in exploring the man of its title decades later that the film may as well be set in 1987.
"The effects - second to Cruise - are the star of the show, but ""Top Gun: Maverick"" surprises in its quieter moments. "
"Somehow Cruise's foray back into the danger zone will be remembered more than the original, setting a new standard in the era of reboots."
Don't be fooled — it's the same glorified military recruitment video that the original was.
"Despite my issues, Top Gun: Maverick accomplishes what it sets out to do: deliver an expertly crafted nostalgia machine that pays tribute to its predecessor while making some notable improvements."
"Cheesy at times and faulted, but absolutely exhilarating and emotionally moving. A marvelous ""in theatre"" movie experience."
"The aerial footage is indeed the best you have ever seen up to this point. Even on a standard 2D screen, it feels like you're up there, hanging on for dear life."
Top Gun plays the phoenix game by rising from the ashes in glittery form. 
Tom Cruise is here to save cinema. He's here to save America. And I'm here for it.
"Mixing excellent visuals, a strong story, great performances with the right amount of nostalgia and spectacle, Top Gun: Maverick is one of the best cinematic experiences I’ve had in a long time."
"If this sounds like hokum, it is. But the storytelling too reminds you of the best version of old Hollywood, broad strokes rendered with watchmaker care."
"The storyline is passable, acting is good, dialogue is fine, and there are some humorous moments."
"Don't confuse this movie with wretched remakes like 'Firestarter' and 'Point Break,' because this one is as good as the original. It has the same strengths and the same weaknesses."
"This is stellar. Top Gun: Maverick feels like The Irishman for blockbusters, with the criticism going much more outward than inward. If you’d like to ask Tom Cruise about his opinion on the state of studio filmmaking, here’s your answer."
"If you love Top Gun, you'll love Maverick."
Absolutely thrilling. You truly feel like you're in the plane with Tom Cruise pulling Gs. 
"I'm almost embarrassed to admit how much I liked this... Everything I hated about [the original], I love about this one. "
"The film is not without its problems, but it’s a near-perfect master class in giving the people what they want."
"Sure, the aerial action sequences are cool, but it’s the story, a star-studded cast, and that soundtrack...that makes Maverick the stuff movies should be."
"With some more to it than hard-driven action, with smart, crisp writing in the right irreverent tone, and with characters of more than a single dimension, this exhilarating legacy sequel sees off a much-vaunted 1980s original that doesn't even come close"
"Maverick is truly one for the ages in its deliverance of a distilled summer blockbuster whose thrills are strong enough to inspire highs totally indistinguishable from narcotics. Beware, and welcome to the Danger Zone."
"Compared to the original, this sequel is 70% less sweaty, 85% less sexy, and 90% more tween appropriate. Top Gun: Maverick is a tale of redemption both for Maverick and for the original film."
"Perhaps the most admirable quality of Top Gun: Maverick is that it never pretends to be anything other than what its core audience wants it to be: a thoughtful, finely-crafted action film that will wow audiences with its sounds and images."
"Top Gun’s appeal is built on US exceptionalism, on competitive machismo, on bread and butter heroics. The sequel offers it polished and unreconstructed. "
"McDonagh finds the perfect moments to insert humor, but the film’s comedic turns often serve to underscore the scope of the tragedy."
A fascinating examination of male loneliness and hurt feelings.
McDonagh uses the conflict between Pádraic and Colm to serve as a metaphor for the Irish Civil War. Brother against brother. Friends against friends. Their friendship loses itself in the fables of Inisherin forever.
"Its heartbreak is as potent as its comedy, both intertwined with the rhythms of the dialogue. "
It's delightful to watch these two character actors go back and forth...These two actors [Colin Farrell & Brendan Gleeson] are at the top of their game. 
Colin Farrell’s performances lifts this quirk and dark comedy from Martin McDonagh. 
"The Banshees of Inisherin, as the title implies, is about death, both literal and figurative, but it’s the sad demise of a friendship that forms the bedrock of this brilliant, often poignant, frequently funny Irish fable."
"Strikingly funny and heartbreakingly honest, Martin McDonagh returns to form by telling the tale of a non-romantic breakup, the sadness of being dumped, and the tricky business of dumping someone. "
"Martin McDonagh explores the painful part of human relationships by finding the comedy and gore contained within.

"
"The Banshees of Inisherin is brilliant beyond belief. Darkly Hilarious, emotional, & Richly layered with themes of fate, friendship, & death. Colin & Brendan were stunning! Martin McDonagh though might of just directed & wrote his best film of his career "
"The Banshees of Inisherin fluctuates from deeply sad to darkly humorous, a mirror of life itself."
"The Banshees of Inisherin is a hilarious, morbid, and beautifully shot film with astounding performers bringing mortality’s uncertainties front and center."
"Inisherin left me quite disappointed, as I hoped for an experience that made me reflect upon my own “stamp of immortality” or the light fractures in the bonds I have had during my life. It isn’t the best of McDonagh, but certainly not the worst."
"""The Banshees of Inisherin"" is a movie that could only come from the mind of Martin McDonagh. The writer-director remains a singular talent, whose dialogue jumps off the screen and becomes the star of the show. His latest is no different.

"
"We're beholding a totally gratuitous drama, driven by inexplicable motives. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The real instigator isn’t whimsy, but an encroaching modernity and its sense of linear history."
"a delicate balancing act, and McDonagh pulls it off with astonishing grace, punctuating the film’s humanity with heavy doses of ambiguity that keep you thinking and wrestling with the characters long after the credits have rolled"
"Captures the fragile state of being a human in one grand swoop of wit and weltschmerz — the film’s contours elegantly morose, its humour dark and bitter-sweet, its inhabitants erratic and gloriously eloquent, its landscape a mystery onto itself."
"Keoghan, one of the strangest actors working today, jerks his performances wildly between “this guy is the greatest actor I have ever seen” and “this kid is getting a little too weird.” "
"There’s no shortage of meaning or metaphor in this robust tale featuring the year’s best ensemble cast.

"
"The rat-a-tat of rifles and thunderous clatter of cannons are but a momentary distraction, piercing the peaceful quiet of the fictional Island on which he lives in playwright and filmmaker Martin McDonagh’s dark parable The Banshees of Inisherin."
"The juxtaposition of mellow, ponderous music with outward conflicts always makes interesting contrasts, just like mixing comedy with drama, humour and sadness, which McDonagh is so apt in doing. "
"The Banshees of Inisherin is a movie about men—their stupidity, their ambitions, and their inability to communicate—but Kerry Condon is the secret to the film’s success."
"It has some notable performances by the cast that offer, in a hidden way, readings about the absurdity that divides the ties of a nation, but many times its tragicomedy becomes dull and loses the desired dramatic wellness. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Capturing unstable humanity, along with black comedy and the brevity of life changing our decisions daily, within a motion picture isn’t easy work, but McDonagh strikes a nice balance of moods and tones."
"115 minutes that, more than a movie, shape a state of mind. One that, little by little, gets under your skin by force of sadness, a shady sense of humor and that kind of existentialism capable of breaking the spirit of the most optimistic human being."
"Martin McDonagh paints a devastating portrait of men in general. The stupid in-fighting, the self-sabotage, and the endless quarrelling — instead of spending their lives doing something valuable for themselves and those around them."
The film has its charm because the director imprints valuable doses of humor. [Full review in Spanish] 
"The most amazing thing about it is the fact it explores such huge ideas as the meaning of life, while simultaneously looking at the micro-aggressions of two stupid men with no capacity to deal with their own emotions."
"Writer-director Martin McDonagh’s brilliantly crafted film offers a master’s class in pacing, with each successive scene building on the previous one until it has grown from a small, sweet Irish tale into a pitch-black, gut-punch of a tragicomedy."
McDonough cultivates within his dark comedic mind an original Irish fable rooted in James Joyce and W.B. Yeats.
"Witty dialogue tempers the cynical take on the human condition in The Banshees of Inisherin, which promises more black comedy from filmmaker Martin McDonagh."
The film's decision to loop in the actual events of the Irish Civil War to parallel Pádraic and Colm’s feud feels a bit clumsy. 
"Realism coexists with artifice. It's a heartbreaking world, but hilarious. [Full review in Spanish] "
A memorable and audacious tale of self-destruction and how disturbing human relationships can be. [Full review in Spanish] 
"In a state of utter solitude, depression, and coldness, the real search is for a feeling, any feeling, in whatever form it comes. It isn't hard to understand these two protagonists... [Full review in Spanish]"
... A unique story about a wounded friendship and the disastrous consequences of an absurd disagreement. [Full review in Spanish]
"Martin McDonagh's humor resides in the wounds of his characters, who, suffering from inflamed emotional wounds, know how to aim precisely at the weak spots of those they want to hurt. [Full review in Portuguese]"
... A tedious nonsense.
"The Banshees of Inisherin is not the kind of comedy that will make you smile, but rather one where laughter quickly turns into tears at the absurd fragility of human relationships."
There is no other choice but to surrender. And laugh. If only for the sake of not despairing. [Full review in Spanish] 
... An everyday pursuit that doesn't fail to be the eternal quest to comprehend the meaning of our existence. [Full review in Spanish]
... The rawness with which McDonagh delivers his reflection on the cycle of life makes The Banshees of Inisherin an ingenious and melancholic parable about disenchantment. [Full review in Spanish]
"As with all good movies, this one has various layers. [Full review in Spanish]"
"McDonagh is, for my money, the best writer in the business. Farrell and Gleeson are the perfect vessels for his unique brand of dark, heartbreaking, hilarity. A near perfect movie. "
"An agonizingly slow watch, but it’s worth your patience mainly for the acting..."
The scenes with his pet donkey Jenny alone will stop you in the tracks.
" a film that is grounded in profoundly powerful performances, and a script so clever and funny that I laughed out loud time and again, all the while fascinated, horrified, and deeply moved."
It offers the best catalog possible from its director's virtues. [Full review in Spanish] 
"The tonal bait and switch from dark comedy to introspective, sensitive drama is what makes The Banshees of Inisherin among the year's best."
"Simply watching Farrell's eyebrows as Pádraic faces his changing circumstances is entertaining, emotional and evocative; the depths and shades he can relay with a twitch, many actors can't muster with their entire bodies."
"McDonagh’s sparkling dialogue, with pathos and comedy infused into every line, is delightful as always. Farrell, Gleeson, Keoghan and Condon make the poetry feel like natural speech."
"Confucius comes into play. ""If you seek revenge dig two graves, one for yourself.""
Hala-feckin-luya."
"...a stark reminder of how ego, pride, and an incessant need for control can consume anyone.  A film powerfully written and brilliantly constructed by Martin McDonagh."
"The Banshees of Inisherin gathers human pain through its characters who, little by little, cease to be as they increasingly see themselves as trapped souls in grief... [Full review in Spanish]"
Farrell and Gleeson have a great onscreen friction.
"Insensitively dark, peculiarly humorous and wildly depressing, The Banshees of Inisherin touches the puerile, the hilarious and the creepy."
"Gleeson is terrific, as usual, but Farrell shows extraordinary range and depth."
"Farrell is in top form… lingers behind the eyes with a healthy dose of personal reflection… gets the point across while rubber-stamping the conclusion with ambiguity, a single shortfall in a sometimes-amusing tragedy-in-the-making."
A too dark comedy for my taste. Acting is great all round but the story is muddled.
The Banshees of Inisherin is just another feather in McDonagh’s cap and it might be the film that finally wins him the full roster of accolades he deserves.
"I learned so much Irish slang against my will, but it was worth it. "
Banshees is a darkly funny and provoking tale that is certainly one of the best movies of the year.
A movie that bleeds with authenticity for its locations and local culture. And bleeds for other reasons.
"The Banshees Of Inisherin is dark, tragic, and somehow humorous in an overall somber undertone that gives audiences multiple layers to dissect. 

Colin Farrell’s range as an actor is incredible."
"A beautifully bizarre tale of wistfulness that actually caused me to laugh out loud from its tragicomic tone. It certainly won’t be for everyone (I can’t quite put my finger on why…), but if you don’t absolutely hate it, you just might love it."
"There’s a tried and tested formula from McDonagh’s back catalogue at work, that starts somewhere in blackly comic absurdity before the humour starts to drain away like let blood until all that is left is bleakness."
Martin McDonagh expertly threads humour and pathos like a master weaver who knows exactly when to change colours.
"What begins as a story of provincial buffoonery gradually reveals itself as an allegory of Irish history and character. I don’t know why allegories are all the rage in movies nowadays, but this one is especially poignant."
"McDonagh narrowly missed making a masterpiece here, but these performances are not to be missed."
"Colin Farrell, who has so many different films on this year’s resume, shows he’s more than just a name on a poster. “Banshees” could be the film that puts him in the upper ranks of all actors."
"[Martin] McDonagh's reflection on mortality and human connection is equal parts humorous, heartbreaking and strange. It's the best film of 2022."
"The Banshees of Inisherin is enchanting, poignant, and relentlessly entertaining while leaving one with the inspiration to redefine what constitutes a real friendship and those are are simply associates for a season, reason or a lifetime."
"McDonagh has it all, a great script, amazing cinematography, an astonishing score, & some of the best ensemble performances this year! Farrell & Gleeson are off the charts with their roles but everyone one around them makes this such a rich grounded story"
There are so many layers here... but rather weirdly I didn't feel the same deep connection with this story and its band of characters as I had with Billboards. Farrell and Gleeson though? I could sit in a cinema with them for days.
"... A film that knows well to avoid metaphors and fables, despite alluding to certain characteristic elements or fantastical creatures. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Banshees is a darkly funny look at mid-life crisis, mortality and our need to remain vital throughout our lives."
The director doesn’t do much to relieve misery or our current existential crisis. That’s why The Banshees of Inisherin feels like both an X-ray of contemporary malaise and a betrayal of Irish romance.
"When a friendship goes bad, both sides are victims in playwright Martin McDonagh's dazzling mosaic of betrayal."
" Dominating the film, Farrell is completely, unglamourously plugged in, as a paradigmatic lost man suddenly knee-deep in collapse and strangeness, and pushed into being a hapless persecutor, not a victim."
"What ultimately pushes it for me from good to great is that sensational undercurrent of the uncanny: the strange behaviour, the sudden punctums of violence, along with the constant growing threat of it."
"The suffocating nature of a small community is on full display here, with petty grievances and barely-concealed sins all around. And yet it's also an extremely funny film, long past the point where you'd expect the laughs to fade"
"The Banshees of Inisherin is not just a beautifully written screenplay. This deeply affecting, warmly humorous, beautifully acted and handsomely photographed (by Ben Davis) film is a major work and top of my list for the best film of 2022."
"Beautifully written and superbly directed by Martin McDonagh with a keen understanding of the ways some people need conversation and attention and others don’t want it, the movie develops moods and insights that are both curious and sly."
"As a comedy duo, Farrell and Gleeson are money in the bank, just as they were in McDonagh’s first feature In Bruges. As a pairing of actor and filmmaker, Farrell and McDonagh are no less in sync."
"Banshees is elevated by a darkly funny scenario that is skilfully realised and used to explore rich, psychological themes.

"
"A magnificent film telling a great, compelling story."
One of the most fulfilling films I’ve seen this year. McDonagh has delivered an utter delight.
"This comic fable has a center as cold and bitter as a lifetime of disappointment, and the irony at its core rings true."
"Mixing black comedy with drama, and themes related to loneliness and male anger, the films develops a very human story, starring characters who cannot stop thinking about their own mortality, and the way they are perceived. Full review in Spanish."
"It’s sad, it’s sardonic, it’s insightful on the subject of toxic masculinity and how it causes and is caused by the soul-death of depression."
"It’s a hallmark of McDonagh’s skill that, for all the film’s mirth, nobody actually tells a joke or deliberately tries to be funny. The humour is all character-based as the film explores the nuances that has soured the relationship between these two men."
"It offers a hilarious and poignant reflection on friendship, loneliness, and man's ambition to transcend and leave a legacy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Evocative cinematography and a gorgeous score make this a spellbinding men-gone-wrong fable.
Martin McDonagh has brilliantly constructed a quaint little universe far removed from modern civilization that will make you stop and admire its eccentricities.
"Taken all together, McDonagh and co. have crafted an exceptional film, one that's strange, quirky, and maybe even a little unsettling to some, but also one that easily stands as one of the very best of the year."
"Funny, but too many jokes don’t land. Compelling and unpredictable, yet even major escalation between the former friends maintains impact that feels minor when expanded beyond them."
"Amid war civil and interpersonal, there is no warning for when our time has come; sometimes all we can do is hope for the best and make our best guess at what to do. It’s a somber notion; one that permeates the film and the audience upon completion."
A haunting tale of friendship and heartbreak.
"Farrell and Gleeson, who exhibited tremendous chemistry from In Bruges, are superb again, mining dramatic riches... all without unbalancing the film's rich comedic instincts."
"Everything Everywhere All at Once is beautifully chaotic, wonderfully weird, and one of the coolest movies ever made."
The Daniels accomplished something wonderful for the audience.
"Michelle Yeoh finally gets a role this decade that pays tribute to her rare talents, and absolutely owns it..."
The genre mashup provides a fuller insight into the characters’ personalities than a straight independent film could depict. The multiverse is a metaphor for the different facets of peoples’ potential and makes their internal lives literal.
"Everything Everywhere All at Once will remind you of why you love cinema. It is fresh, creative, and will leave you laughing and shedding some tears."
An omnipotent being is threatening the multiverse. Who ya gonna call? Spiderman? Dr. Strange? How about a middle-aged Asian-American woman failing as a wife and mother?
"Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the greatest films of all time. Entertaining, hilarious, emotional, wild, unique, action packed, & INSANE"
"At the heart of it all, we ride a roller coaster of emotions that are inventive, complex, stimulating, and raw."
"With such a low budget, it's almost humiliating that so many expensive Hollywood blockbusters can't even reach the heels of so much originality, imagination, excitement, and emotion."
"Everything Everywhere All At Once is a spectacle in the purest sense of the word. A sensory overload, especially in IMAX, the movie is a science fiction, multi-verse spanning love letter to family."
Delightfully disorienting and intellectually absorbing.
"""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is a steaming example of visual, sonic, and thematic noise. Chinese propaganda for propaganda's sake. Vomiting all of the time now. Hollywood pawns. "
"At a few minutes short of two and a half hours, Everything Everywhere All at Once nearly wears out its welcome, but as far as hot dog-fingered audacity goes, the Daniels will make plenty of new eyeballs go googly."
"... Touches upon important themes such as control through technology, media, food, and body while resorting to an anarchic and hilarious sense of humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The filmmakers try to load the entire weight of life, the universe, and everything onto their movie. This is too many things on a bagel."
"Michelle Yeoh proves that being a middle aged immigrant has no boundaries and she is backed up with the amazingly gifted talents of Ke Huy Quan, Jaime Lee Curtis and Stephanie Hsu !  The Daniels provide a supreme sci-fi smorgasbord for the ages."
"It holds within it a great idea, when one disentangles it from the hairball that is the EEAAO narrative. But [...] in all its originality, it telegraphs its message, instead of allowing this intricately constructed ingenious world to be the message."
"The humor, though, is silly and second-rate. The googly eyes, the talking raccoon, the pet rocks at sunset, the parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey—all those work against the cast instead of with it."
"Much like a hallucinogen might cause you to cycle through every human emotion and see your life laid out end to end — theoretically — this film has an ability to dazzle built into every kinetic, colorful, madcap frame."
"... This victorious though regrettable film, or whatever it is, is an incomprehensible mess, foolishly imaginative and cumbersome to watch and listen to. [Full review in Spanish]"
"... their Best Original Screenplay fuses science fiction, action, comedy, and family drama all at once. Genre jumping might be a better term to describe the Daniels’ creative mode of filmmaking."
Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert not only think outside the box but outside the multiverse as well.
"EEAAO is that insufferable child whose parents trot her out in tap shoes, then watch to make sure you register adequate amazement at her Buffalo turns and Bombershays. You appreciate the kid’s skill and preparation — but gawd, how you wish it were over."
"It's a challenging, provocative, manic, self-indulgent movie."
"Raising an ecstatic hot dog middle finger to the negativity of modern times, “EEAAO” urges us to free our minds and accept that it’s OK to be strange."
"The fight between good and evil, right and wrong, social boundaries, mental perceptions and a long list of etc.; will take place among washing machines and calculators (...) everything, everywhere, all at once. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"The Daniels turn in a joyous film, a party so demanding as it is exhilarating.    [Full review in Spanish] 
"
"Laundry, taxes and life"
Some seem to believe this movie is a philosophical masterpiece because characters reach conclusions such as: “nothing matters”.
"...is certainly unique. Exploring the idea of family, existential crises, and other obvious philosophical concepts, the film uses its quasi-futuristic narrative to delve into these topics in ways not often seen in film."
"Family is complicated, messy, difficult to understand, and what matters most in this fantastic multiverse psychedelic drama that at this point needs little introduction..."
"[Gives] us dildo fights, raccoon chefs, hot-dog hands, and muscular pinky fingers. In one of the film's best action scenes, [we have] a fanny pack. [Elsewhere,] two rocks with googly eyes share their deepest fears and comfort each other."
"A wonderfully weird, exhilaratingly all-over-the-place absurdist comedy, led by great performances and a screenplay that is as funny as it is moving."
Everything Everywhere All at Once is a film with just as many lives as we see Yeoh’s Evelyn Quan Wang wade through. 
"A fun, frantic but unexpectedly emotional watch."
"Everything Everywhere All At Once is a marvelous achievement in filmmaking. The Daniels have created one of the best films of the year, and it is sure to inspire the next generation of filmmakers."
Michelle delivered the performance of the year in Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's Everything Everywhere All At Once...
"Visually restless, thematically redundant and the rare movie to be both overwhelming and underwhelming. After only a little while, you’ll desperately long to be simply whelmed."
Everything Everywhere All at Once takes the poignant themes of parental disappointment and life regrets and is able to successfully wrap them up in an absurd and entertaining 2+ hours of craziness.
"Lots of movies and shows entered the multiverse this year, but there was nothing remotely like this one"
"Rarely has a film’s title reflected its contents so well. While may not include everything all at once, it does boasts a range of genre approaches stacked on top of one another and blended into a variety of combinations."
"A true genre-bending wonder with phenomenal performances from the entire cast, stunning visuals, and powerful themes, the hype behind Everything Everywhere All At Once is real! "
I hope this movie exists in every alternate universe.
"An exhausting, confusing, hilariously funny, pleasing assault on the ears and eyes from directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert."
"Never has a film lived up to its title more than this, the most bonkers movie you’ll ever see, equal parts exhilarating and exhausting. I remain leary of the multiverse trend of chaotic storytelling. It shouldn't be repeated. Let “EEAAO” exist on its own."
"...mixes science fiction, martial arts, comedy, fantasy, parody, animation, social realism, and probably a few more styles I’ve left out."
"Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the best films this year. From the editing, set design, world building, pacing/transitions, amazing student choreography and some of the best performances this year from Yeoh, Quan, & Hsu. A NEAR PERFECT FILM!"
Undoubtedly the most creatively chaotic experience I’ve ever seen or likely will ever see.
It's the most original film of the year
EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE is one of the best films of the year. It’s a brave cinematic mirror of all the banal but critical things that make us and our lives important in an indifferent universe.
"Stephanie Hsu threw down one of the best performances of 2022, hands down."
"Delightfully bonkers on the surface, this inventive extravaganza from the directing team called Daniels (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) has a deep layer of family feeling and a well-earned emotional pull at the end."
The most brilliantly bananas movie of 2022 absolutely lives up to its title. Michelle Yeoh kicks all types of butt as a time-travelling laundromat manager in a multiverse of madness.
It’s an apt title—Everything Everywhere All At Once really does have everything...
(The Daniels) Kwan and Scheinert make everything seem possible. 
"The explosion of creative storytelling along with stellar performances by the gifted ensemble led by the incandescent Michelle Yeoh, make for a dense work that should be revisited to continue to peel away the legion of layers that can be found... "
Everything Everywhere All at Once is everything you want from a movie and so much more.
…and in the multiverse Michelle Yeoh is everything!
"The directing duo, Daniels, turned down a Marvel offer to make their delightful new movie. We couldn't be happier."
"I can't promise everyone will like it, because it is so weird. But it's so unique I feel like everybody should give it a shot."
I've always been a fan of Michelle Yeoh and this was a fantastic showcase of her skills. I really liked this movie and was thoroughly entertained. The only negative is that visually it can be VERY overwhelming. 
I greatly enjoyed this and look forward to seeing it multiple times to continue dissecting the visuals and themes. All of the actors brought their A-game and I hope this gets numerous accolades this awards season.
"It is unafraid of being cheesy and silly, leaning into the full potential of its marvelous vulgarity cut with a prevailing sweetness that resonates in a triumphant final act."
"The Daniels, through their quirky, revolutionary and thoroughly entertaining film, offer a winning perspective to our troubles: It all matters exactly because we’re small and stupid."
"A peerless ode to love, life and everything in between."
"One of the most profound and moving sci-fi films I’ve ever seen, as well as being mental and a lot of fun."
Everything Everywhere All At Once is the reason I still go to the movies! We've got a good one here folks.
"The performances are in perfect sync with the Daniels’ giddiness. Michelle Yeoh, at the front and centre of possibly the most memorable role of her career, is the anchor of a film that rarely stops once it gets going."
Everything Everywhere All at Once is an exhilarating ride and an ample showcase of rising and unrealised talent that embodies the beauty of the human spirit through the prism of the preternatural. It is one of the best films of 2022.
Michelle Yeoh pulls off what is arguably the best performance of her storied screen career. 
Everything Everywhere All at Once takes a creative look at familiar topics by way of the multiverse concept.
"Exhilarating, funny and moving, their film is also messy, overstuffed and a trifle exhausting. "
"Some of it is legitimately moving, and gets at the specific pains of an Asian-American family in a more lateral and artistic way than it might have with a more conventional narrative."
"Everything Everywhere All at Once is simply one of the best films of the year. Cinematically brilliant, full of nuanced performances and with incredible themes throughout. 

A24 continues to showcase why it stands as one of the best film studios."
"Whether it’s the draining exposition of the first half or the smothering non-stop ridiculousness of the second half, the film never finds a good balance."
"It’s absurd and wild and wonderful, and will probably make you cry."
"...the undisciplined product of a pair of spitballing concept artists, who too often find themselves pitching out of hiccups in characterization and allegory and embracing the shiny allure of the new whenever nuance become too much to bear..."
"It's smart, idiotic, serious, hilarious, sentimental, routinary, fantastic, complex, simple, easy, hard; it's done it. It's everything. At once. Everywhere. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Hyper-innovative thrill-ride... draws elements of science fiction, martial arts, family values and that ever-expanding storytelling device known as the multiverse, and then throws the whole lot in a blender."
"It’s up there with Mad Max: Fury Road, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and The Matrix, in that it’s a movie that fully embraces the spectacle and artistry of cinema whilst never forgetting about what really matters: story, character, and theme."
"A bit overrated but worth seeing for the great Michelle Yeoh in a very trendy, nth-degree multi-verse, live-action cartoon concept film. (Lionsgate 4K blu-ray)."
"Collaborating with a small team of visual effects artists working in practical media, [Daniels] have achieved a joyous spectacle as exhausting as it is constantly surprising. ... For all of its imagination, this movie's finale feels overlong and preachy."
 This is a film about finding love and connection when you’ve been ground down. Even the bizarre hot dog-handed world gets to have its own deep moments that will likely make you cry. 
The sort of movie Michelle Yeoh deserves. 
"Outrageous, confusing, or confounding? Everything Everywhere All at Once stands out as one of the most original movies to come along in years."
"Everything Everywhere All At Once can be compared to many, many things, but one of the most complimentary things I can say about any movie is that this one felt like a live-action Don Hertzfeldt film."
"A phantasmagorical time-shifting multiverse explosion of kung-fu sci-fi. Chaos reigns supreme, with the screen ablaze with every trick in a director’s arsenal, like an immersive demo of sensory overload."
"It's a whirl, a swirl, a trip, a blast and a juggle as well and, in this universe, the Daniels wouldn't have it any other way."
This is the true virtue that catapults this film into an instant classic: It finds beauty in the ordinary. [Full review in Spanish]
"After maybe, 10-15 minutes of normal stuff -- taxes, laundry, family tensions -- this movie takes off into some of the most imaginative and just plain what-tha’-??????? territory you’ve ever seen."
"Not the perfect movie they've been hyping about, but a visually stunning feature with Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan at the top of their game. An interesting story about embracing the uncertainty of our own destiny. Twenty minutes too long IMO."
"...in Everything Everywhere All at Once, we enter the universes, the many branches of the central character, Evelyn Wang..."
"It makes good use of the idea of a multiverse, showing us the different possibilities of its protagonists, and confidently developing a narrative centred on the relationship between a mother and daughter, and a wife and husband. Full review in Spanish."
"I can't find anything out of the ordinary, except a boredom that is as infinite as the universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Here's what's truly bold about Everything Everywhere All at Once: it doesn't try to be all things to all people. It's a keeper, in any universe."
"The colorful thriller, Everything Everywhere All At Once, is a movie to watch when nothing in the world makes sense anymore because it reminds you of what it is to be human.

Pixar’s delightful ode to female adolescence...
The film stresses how the best way to hold on tight to a child is to loosen your grip.
Turning Red is a rollercoaster of a film that takes different turns as the story unfolds leaving audiences engaged with Mei and her family. It is full of thrills and nostalgia while also feeling like a reinvention of Pixar. 
A delightful surprise! Not just one of Pixar’s most personal stories yet… but a great coming of age story that will bring you back to your days in 8th grade & puberty.
"Turning Red is the riskiest, possibly the most divisive work in Pixar history. Without any remorse or restraint, Domee Shi and Julia Cho unapologetically approach the sensitive topic of (female) puberty in a quite shocking, positively impactful manner."
"Yes, Turning Red is about a specific life and a specific culture, but its specificity is its greatest strength. A lesson we can all learn."
Turning Red finds ways to creatively illustrate the growing pains of adolescence and its root causes. It's a tear-inducing stroll down memory lane.
Even when pandamonium breaks out Shi always has the emotional backdrop fully under control.
"A Pixar film with an energized spirit, along with a gentle and patient heart."
"With winning characters and an engaging storyline, Turning Red is a humorous look at the awkwardness of growing up and figuring out how to break away and hold on at the same time."
"Turning Red celebrates femininity, friendship, and family, in addition to being really funny."
"Pixar movies are often in the hunt for end-of-the-year awards, and “Turning Red” looks like a good bet this awards season."
"""Turning Red rejects this progression of events as a birthright, and allows Meilin the agency to choose her own path and lean into the difference that makes her special. It’s a truly stunning execution of a much-needed message."""
"Whether you zero in on generations of female empowerment and healing, or the lush tail of a gigantic furry beast, there is something for everyone in Turning Red."
Turning Red finds Pixar surveying some of its most mature subject matter yet - strengthened by cultural specificity - while simultaneously retaining the studio’s signature heart and humor.
"a funny, compassionate and intelligent animated coming-of-age film with art that communicates the beauty of Chinese culture… addresses the myriad, complex, feelings and sensations of puberty and adolescence with honesty and sensitivity to nuance"
"Director Domee Shi, who won an Academy Award® for her Pixar short film Bao, makes her feature film directing debut with a story that is both extremely personal and thematically universal."
Disney/Pixar are taking a big leap with this film - they've mined the Grimm fairy tales and harvested their own back catalogue - but they're hopefully finding that investing in filmmakers and their own personal experiences pays equal dividends.
"Whilst Luca took obvious notes from the Studio Ghibli playbook, Turning Red is more like if The Farewell was also a shojo anime, but it’s an absolutely joyous, relatable, and heartfelt experience."
"'Turning Red' is the first Pixar feature solely directed by a woman. Domee Shi's exuberant film tells girls (and boys) that it’s okay to change, to feel strong emotions, to take the time to become your true self — even if the process is a little messy."
"To quote boy band sensation, 4*Town, there really is “Nobody Like U” when it comes to Turning Red."
There’s something powerful that the film that’s going to stand as the future of Pixar is made by a team of amazingly creative women.
"Don't mistake all that gloss, those earworm tunes and that endearing red panda for fluff, though: Turning Red has sweetness, soul and smarts, and it's another of Pixar's gems."
Red turns everything into a monumental power struggle that vindicates the right to dissent (adolescent or not) ... in these cancel culture times where people avoid uncomfortable conversations as they would landmines. [Full review in Spanish]
"Minor Pixar, but by no means unsatisfactory. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The film is a bold step forward for Pixar, not just in how it tackles more mature subject matter, or how it champions underrepresented communities in a way that puts creativity front and center."
"Turning Red may not be the strongest of Pixar's lineup, but it's an insightful and sentimental story of a young girl's reluctant journey through the monster that is puberty. It's also a blast of energy, full of joy, honesty, and plenty of hormones."
"Touching and entertaining, yet comforting for the young ones who have felt weird, insecure or embarrassed about their bodies.

"A brilliant film with a powerful, heartfelt, feminist spirit that becomes a song of absolute rebellion. 
[Full review in Spanish]"
"An exciting, fun, and chaotically adolescent film. [Full review in Spanish]"
Turning Red manages to take a viewer into these deep waters without losing the playfulness and silly humor that make it a top-notch family movie.
"Turning Red is a great lesson in respect, understanding and embracing labels of all kinds, while touting a very catchable soundtrack.  I need that 4 Town concert in my life like yesterday!"
"It's definitely an admirable film. It proves that, hopefully, Pixar is going in a different direction where they finally realize that they're okay. They're well-established. Let's experiment a little. You don't have to play it safe anymore. "
"The film succeeds in conveying the emotional turbulence of adolescence and the burden women face once they realize theyre gonna bleed every month, but ultimately its a turn-off due to the mom character who is so over-the-top protective."
"Love and wholeheartedly support the normalization of puberty specifically menstrual cycles. Beautiful depiction of family, friendship and the differences between generational viewpoints. Its catchy songs will stay with you."
"This is a movie for anyone who has experienced the turmoil Mei experiences, which is to say just about everyone."
"The personalities pop, and brainy Meis girl squad is a vivid portrait of intense and moody tweens...The creators added distinct little extras, such as A+ student Mei twirling her pencil like a gunslinger and all the roofs are shaped like panda ears."
"Shi redirects the specific in Turning Red into the universal effectively, raising it above racial and cultural boundaries. "
"Writers Domee Shi and Julia Cho, weave a beautifully textured screenplay that captures the challenges of coming-of-age."
"A heartwarming and groundbreaking entry into Disney-Pixar’s catalogue, thanks to its thoughtful, honest — and funny — depictions of puberty, menstruation, adolescent rebellion, and life as a 13-year-old girl."
"I enjoyed a lot of it, I was annoyed by some of it, and I came away from it thinking it was a B- Pixar film. "
"I think it chickens out a little bit from telling [a story about puberty] to tell a more universal one... All of that is kind of fun, but slight. "
"I liked the film, I didn't love it... Parts of this film are a case where more is less. "
Turning Red is a fun film for tweens and a therapy session for adults.
"And as Pixar never fails to do, the story mainlines straight into the heart and the humanity of the characters and by extension, the audience -- in all our marvellous, rebellious, complicated glory."
"With Turning Red, Pixar abandons decades of nuanced storytelling and warms over Disneys clichéd advice to follow your heart. "
Turning Red illustrates the counterintuitive truism that becoming a parent actually seems to make people forget what it was like to be a child.
"Despite its specificity, this is a movie that should be enjoyable for most everyone."
Turning Red is clearly a labor of love -- a beautifully animated film that evokes an intense sense of time and place.
"A big warm hug of a film that deserves to be cherished and celebrated, and Domee Shi is quickly establishing herself as one of the most unique and exciting voices working in animation today."
"In Turning Red, the next generation is personified by girls from traditionally marginalized groups. And it isn't daunting at all. It's affirming, and I suggest you tune in."
"A wonder in the way 13-year-old girls can be: monstrous one moment, heart-melting the next."
The expressiveness of anime works well to reflect the intensity of Mei Lees evolving feelings and paints her world with the vibrance it deserves.
"For all of its merits, the film ultimately advocates a wrongheaded central message under the guise of empowerment: embrace who you are, even your reckless vices and dangerous impulses, and dont let anyone stop you."
Pixar has created its best film in recent years from an unbeatable mix of high-voltage comedy and their usual heart that doesn't put the message above a unique experience. [Full review in Spanish]
"Just like how Mei turned into a giant fluffy red panda, while not everything about the movie is perfect, it did manage to take its changes and turn them into something thats so much fun."
'Turning Red' is panda-monium with humor and heart.
Pixar's bravest movie yet.
"Pixar's latest is a tender, colorful and funny tale about adolescence, family and cultural identity. Full Review in Spanish"
"Pixar's latest takes the ever-popular ""I Was A Teenage Werewolf"" monster-puberty allegory and ramps up the awkward adorability for an infectiously sweet, surprisingly thoughtful and energetically funny coming of age comedy"
"It mixes messages about self-realisation and the discovery of one's identity, with the normalisation of adolescent femininity, and a very funny fantasy story. Full review in Spanish."
"It's a zippy film, faster and funnier than many Pixar offerings. It's also unabashedly girl-centric, even talking about puberty in a wonderfully honest, messy way."
"Another exceptional coming-of-age tale from a studio that excels at them...a wonderful work of representational art, one that offers people who might not otherwise see such things a chance to witness themselves both on the screen and in the credits."
"Like the best Pixars, you don’t need to have a kid to see it. It’s excellent entertainment for grown-up people, too."
"Like some of its characters, its a little different, and a little strange, and that should be celebrated."
A unique and entertaining effort that continues the studios recent hot streak.
"Pixar has devised some inventive ideas, but who would ever imagine a story about 13-year-old girl's puberty and periods? But that’s what director-cowriter Domee Shi has done and done well."
Turning Red hits its key points about coming of age with authenticity and without apology. 
Highly recommended.
"If you are of the more specific audience that Turning Red aims to talk to, then it will feel entirely personal.  If not, theres still no reason that such a beautifully realised film cant be appreciated on its other merits."
"Turning Red will make some folks uncomfortable with its themes and its turned-up-to-11 energy, but its a worthwhile addition to the Pixar canon and a good treat for anyone who is still young at heart."
"The animation is a tad too ordinary by Pixar’s standards, but, hey, the jokes work, and an enthusiastic voice cast bring their A-game."
The studio arguably hasn't produced anything this affecting since the overlooked Brave.
"I suspect tweens and teens are not the real targets anyway. The film often seems squarely, deliberately, aimed at their parents instead, offering them a gentle (if busy) reminder that they were young once too."
"It’s a cute-as-a-button story about the power of relationships, found family, and finding yourself that feels like the warm embrace of a hot water bottle gingerly placed over your cramps."
Turning Red is a potent reminder of the power of animation and Pixar’s undisputed knack for storytelling that packs an emotional punch.
"Turning Red stands apart from the Pixar pack for being unafraid to show puberty in all its uncomfortable glory, while being funny, charming and pleasantly poignant at the same time."
"Once again, Pixar crafts an entertaining, comical adventure about deeper emotions, this time exploring a perky young teen's sense of self-identity."
"Disney-Pixar packs a whole lot into this second-tier Pixar move that, to me, stands right up there with the best of Pixar over the decades	."
"A nuanced and compassionate exploration of how to reconcile differences, embrace change no matter how painful, and learn the value of seeing family members as human beings rather than extensions of yourself."
Director Domee Shi crafts a charming coming-of-age story for Pixar.
"Turning Red doesn't transcend being a kids film, but for a kids film it is fine"
"Pixar’s new film is charming, nostalgic, and, with Chinese-Canadian lead character Mei, a watershed moment for representation."
"An homage to all things to all things adolescent girlhood, from the crew of close friends who come to mean more to you than your own family to the cult-like obsession with boybands to that unforgettable moment when your first period arrives."
"As a Pixar fanatic, Turning Red is a welcome return to form after the unfocused Onward, but only time and rewatches will tell if it belongs in the storied animation studios upper echelon."
"This is a story we haven't seen before from Pixar, universally relatable, but also universally ignored in films geared towards younger audiences ... Director Domee Shi finds a cute, fluffy way to break the taboo of puberty."
"Turning Red is another fun and interesting entry in the Pixar filmography. It may not be as broadly appealing as some of their earlier fare, but its great to see the studio expanding its profile to tell different types of stories."
"Yes, there’s formula at work here. But who doesn’t enjoy an exquisitely manipulated cry?"
 one of the years most heartfelt stories.
"Turning Red is a deeply personal & relatable story that is bursting with creativity, nostalgia & joy. It is one of the most ambitious Pixar films.

"
"Turning Red is easily one of Pixar's best, most brilliant efforts in years. Sure, it's fun, funny, and tender, but what really carries it to greatness is its ability to put us back in touch with our youth and give ourselves a bit more grace."
Turning Red is an utterly charming film and an impressive debut feature for Domee Shi.
Shi and company draw an agreeable and emotionally sincere descent into the adolescent experience. 
"Turning Red, like most Pixar films, has an uncanny way of drilling down into a plangent set of adult emotions while remaining nothing less than a fizzing, sherbet-filled entertainment for children."
A kinetic and funny adventure that is more entertaining than transformative.
"Turning Red is easily the funniest Pixar production since Inside Out -- and only a little less insightful, without the full-of-itself attitude of Soul."
"This is a smart, entertaining movie for two acts and a perfectly OK one for the third."
he frantic pacing (Shi lists Edgar Wright among her influences) and blink-and-miss-it background humour makes it a joy to watch.
It’s long been a Hollywood truism that centering women in coming-of-age stories guarantees that men will not watch them. Turning Red is a film that says fluff to all that. 
"This weird premise is fast & funny, & if youre into adolescent symbolism it has higher transitional girl-to-woman aspirations, but something seems missing through reliance on big set pieces & bizarre comic uses of the panda. Good that's it's streaming."
"Happening is a bravura piece of filmmaking. It is executed cleanly, precisely, without shying away from anything but without dwelling on it either."
"Diwan’s adaptation is unique for its unflinching resolve to show the callousness of men (the intransigent doctors and exploitative men), the inadequacies of social structures, and the need for solidarity amongst women."
"It isn't the best film depicting the subject; however, it is an essential watch, now more than ever before."
"[Never] gives into the powerful didactic or melodramatic forces … with director Audrey Diwan retaining a measured, unflinching focus. That carries over into [Anamaria] Vartolomei's understated performance."
"Happening is a movie that dispenses with the pleasantries of deep side characters or even growth for its lead role. It’s a vivid, unsettling depiction of abortion in a place and time, sordidly familiar right now..."
"Artful and socially resonant, Happening is one of the most poignant and moving films of the year."
"A film of international importance, told with empathy, sincerity and anger."
"Vartolmei delivers a remarkable performance, underplaying Anne’s emotional responses in a way that makes them register all the more strongly on the viewer."
Happening unsubtly and successfully acts as a reminder of the importance of abortion rights at a moment when reactionary creeps the world over are pushing back.
"Happening plays at a surprisingly quick pace, wrapping us up in the suffocating, terrifying totality of the situation. It's only Diwan’s second film, but it feels like veteran work -- so engrossing, so carnal, so full of empathy that it hurts to look at."
"The most-need-to-be-seen feature of the year . . . . In this grippingly honest, no-holds-barred film, a 23-year-old lit student seeks an abortion in 1963 France, an act for which she, her doctor, and anyone else who aids her can be sent to prison."
"When Diwan has to choose between reckoning the protagonist or impacting the audience, she chooses the latter. And for a few minutes, everything falls apart... almost impeccable otherwise. Almost. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It’s brutal in spots, but especially vital to watch right now."
"the film, calibrated in passing weeks, closely tracks Anne’s efforts – greatly circumscribed and increasingly desperate – to choose her own future."
"No, it's not an upbeat subject. But perhaps now, with Roe overturned and people experiencing the consequences of abortion bans, it's time to watch this movie."
"Diwan relies on a raw and daring mise-en-scène, and avoids becoming a pamphlet. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Happening is an honest, harrowing, frighteningly timely, moving, and powerful experience."
"Anamaria Vartolomei’s lead performance is necessarily and intensely physical—and subject to some harrowing bodily choreography in the homestretch—but what binds us to her is a sense of the perceptive, gifted writer trapped behind weary, terrified eyes."
"Happening presenta con firmeza cómo la experiencia traumática no radica en el acto del aborto en sí, sino en el terror que genera un embarazo forzado por falta de apoyo médico adecuado. "
"Happening is haunting and shattering, immaculately crafted, unwavering in its honesty, and as confronting as it needs to be, and it wields all of the above with passion and purpose."
One of the most talked-about movies from this year’s Sundance Film Festival is about to get a whole lot more attention.
"Vartolomei gives a wonderfully nuanced performance, showcasing the emotional turmoil and exhaustion Anne goes through by herself..."
"A few times I had to look away from the screen, even if the theater was empty. It moved me. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Not a moment feels didactic, and Anne never seems like a case study. Instead, the film thrums with the practical resolve of a young woman desperate to begin her own life before creating another."
"A stunning, realist and visceral achievement."
"Happening brings compassion to a story many women have faced, and many have been forced to endure."
"There’s the constant sense of someone poised, ready to run, alert and frightened. But since the battle she is facing is an unwanted pregnancy, there is no possibility of physically removing herself from the situation."
"Based on a true story, the realistic drama Happening shows without judgment what a college student in 1963 France experienced when she wanted to terminate an unplanned pregnancy, at a time when abortion was illegal in France. "
Anne’s journey nears its end with one of the most unsettling scenes a movie is likely to produce this year. It graphically depicts what pro-abortion rights advocates say with regularity: That laws to ban abortions will only outlaw medically safe ones. 
 Couldn’t be more harrowing -- or timely -- as it unflinchingly confronts a woman’s right to choose. 
"With Happening, Diwan has crafted a horror story that is becoming a haunting and very real possibility."
"This is a film, about abortion, that’s arriving with impeccable timing."
"Happening is a drama in the classic French screen idiom of eschewing tonal hyperbole and over-explicit messaging in favor of a more low-key, naturalistic approach. But the rising panic Anne struggles to suppress from public view is palpable, nonetheless."
"Carefully captures the nightmare that befalls the protagonist, with images that combine intimacy and everyday life while the drama -along with [her] gestation- grows. [Full review in Spanish]"
At the moment there is not a more important and more challenging piece of cinema at the theaters than Happening. 
"Taking place in 1963, its harrowing story feels immediate and personal – and relevant.
Tightly shot, with an unflinching intimacy that showcases Romanian-born actress Anamaria Vartolomei’s brave performance..."
"A shocking drama deftly handling its plot, with a wonderful performance by Vartolomei, combining vulnerability and strength. One of the most powerful experiences I've ever had in a movie theater. Full review in Spanish."
"Still, Happening deserves to be assessed on its own merits, rather than how it lands in proximity to U.S. politics."
Happening tackles the difficult subject of illegal abortion in 1960’s France with restraint and compassion.
"Despite its decades-ago setting, Happening has never been more relevant, particularly for audiences in America. Diwan’s drama serves as a warning of what people may experience if Roe is overturned. "
"The story of ""Happening"" is what happens in secret when the right to choose is eliminated. The how of ""Happening"" is that none of this should be secret. "
The no-holds-barred approach to the abortion procedure and its aftermath is the kind of interpretation of real life that great cinema does best.
"It directly captures the crippling barbarism of a system that cares not a bit about human beings, as well as men whose limited vision allows them to only see Anne in one of two ways. "
"Happening goes further as a beautiful coming-of-age story, where Anne’s long pursuit to end the pregnancy is also one of self-discovery."
"Happening is both powerful and, in this fraught moment, necessary."
Films don't get any more timely than this French drama about an unwanted pregnancy. Anamaria Vartolomei is a revelation.
"Diwan's film seems to explore several genres.  A tick-tock thriller, an espionage picture, and a horror show, but most of all, this distressing abortion drama feels contemporary, even though it’s set almost 60 years in the past.  A must-see!"
"There’s nothing cautionary about this brutal, deeply empathetic movie; it is a horror film rooted in everyday reality."
"Happening isn't particularly political, at least not in the sense that it proffers a particular agenda. It's a deeply personal episode from a particular life told in a straightforward manner without a lot of moralizing."
"Happening is a beautifully shot film, and Vartolomei gives a fantastic performance of a woman unaware of where to turn, or to whom."
"More thoughtful and visually sophisticated than what Hollywood tends to produce, Diwan’s film nevertheless has few ideas of its own—a disappointment, considering the conceptual experimentation (and knotty objectives) of the source novel. "
“Happening” is a nightmarish exploration of a controversial subject.
"Director Diwan...gives her young star, Anamaria Vartolomei, plenty of running room to create a stunning character study about a strong-willed young woman who risks prison to try to control her own fate and body. "
"Whether you condone this film or condemn it, “Happening” presents a brutal reality."
"Happening is an introduction to an intriguing new director, but as the abortion debate consumes our nation once again, it’s also much more than that."
" Heartfelt, heartbreaking, heart wrenching."
"Diwan's film denotes the perfect portrait of a nightmare.
[Full review in Spanish]"
"""Happening"" isn't a political movie, it's a horror movie."
A sobering reminder that the consequences of limiting access to safe medical care aren’t just theoretical but existential.
"Audrey Diwan’s film recreates a woman’s isolating, wrenching efforts to get an abortion in France in the 1960s."
"Poignant, pressing and important."
"A smart, engaging, and well-made film."
"The empathy shown for Anne’s predicament extends beyond the pregnancy; it addresses questions of personal desire, sexuality, and agency over her body and the events that determine the rest of her life. "
"The urgency of Happening’s message comes across loud and clear as a timely warning, and Vartolomei’s laconic performance drives home the despair and highlights the moral courage it takes for Anne to resist."
"Vartolomei’s performance is amazing. The way her face registers everything she endures, from grim determination to frustration to mental and physical agony, seems genuine, authentic."
"As the world gets darker and tougher for birthing bodies, unflinching stories about what’s at stake will only become more precious and more powerful. Happening is an exceptional example of just such a story."
A movie of chilling honesty...
A potent drama filled with anger and rage… [Full review in Spanish]
It feels like it was made for this moment... Eerily prescient. 
The film has a dispassionate air about it -- which makes it even scarier -- but sometimes it goes a little overboard in its semi-documentary direction. But it's quite a powerful experience. 
"It manages to build a feminist story, which shows us how little progress we have made in the last sixty years regarding abortion and the rights that women have in relation to said procedure. Full review in Spanish."
As a film this is well-crafted art but take others to watch it for what the story has to say.
"Obviously, it’s far more timely now, and I’ll be curious whether I’d feel differently about it if I watched it for the first time now. "
"Shot by Diwan in unflinching realism, the horror of Happening is specific to Anne, but also serves as a universal warning if abortion once again becomes illegal.
"
"A timely, unflinching masterpiece. "
"With her sophomore feature, the director opts for minimality, slowly closing the window of a young woman’s freedom, shooting each scene with a tender and realitist lens."
Happening remains an incredibly powerful film that drives home the fact that outlawing abortions will not prevent people from getting them—it just means they will go to more dangerous lengths in order to do so.
"An intense, intimate tale of historical illegal abortion, with a central performance of focused terror; a harrowing body horror that looms again. I cannot overstate the absolute urgency of this film."
"The film’s unflinching approach makes certain scenes difficult to watch. Yet bolstered by Vartolomei’s audaciously committed portrayal, it’s even harder to ignore."
"Absolutely not for the faint of heart, the movie catalogs the horrors Anne experiences while trying to terminate the pregnancy so that she can stay the course as a scholar and chart her own fate. Happening could not be more staggering, or timely. "
"If Happening often feels like a punch to the solar plexus, that's exactly what it should be."
"In a part that asks a lot of her, Vartolomei masters the art of silence, somehow managing to react, consider, and protest, often without a saying single word."
[A] tense and quietly radical film...
"If you find “Happening” too distressing for words, think of “Happening” writ large."
"I’d say it’s not for the squeamish, but you know what? It is for the squeamish, especially those who hold power over women’s bodies in this country but don’t trust them to make decisions on their own behalf."
[T]he message is only as effective as it is because the film exists solely in the realm of the personal.
"An engrossing, honest and gripping emotional journey. It's just as powerful as Vera Drake and 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days."
Vartolomei is revelatory in the role. She toes the line between tragic and empowering in a way that makes it hard to believe the Romanian actor has so few credits to her name beyond short films.
"A realist thriller that morphs, sans sentimentality or platitudes, into a quietly affecting portrait of female solidarity."
"Throughout, Diwan’s gaze remains clear, direct, fearless. She shows you a part of life that the movies rarely do."
It’s the type of movie that deserves praise and your undivided attention no matter when it comes to theaters near you.
"Diwan’s fly-on-the-wall direction, echoed by Laurent Tangy’s ultra-tight cinematography and the production’s naturalistic lighting and sound, draws us into the suffocating immediacy of every passing day."
"In an ideal world, “Happening” would simply be a lesson about a dark history. Instead, it might be a chilling portent of our future.

"
"...intensely within Anne’s point of view, “Happening” envisions her circumstance as a claustrophobic, ever-tightening vise.  It is impossible to watch this horrifying, true story from 1963 France without contemplating the U.S. in 2022."
"What distinguishes Happening, Diwan’s second feature film, is, overwhelmingly, her and Laurent Tangy’s tightly composed cinematography and Vartolomei’s riveting, steely performance."
"Racked with emotional tension and visceral turmoil, it paints a painful portrait of how women have suffered—and will, sadly, continue to suffer—for the ability to make their own precious choices."
A simultaneously infuriating and rousing portrait of female resolve and bravery in the face of misogynistic hardship.
"No matter where you come down on the abortion issue, Happening is a film worthy of your time and consideration."
"Happening is that rare, unflinching, suffocatingly harrowing autobiographical story that must be seen and mandated as part of school curriculums worldwide"
"A specific tale of the 1960s, this story of an unwanted pregnancy could not echo more profoundly than it does today. "
"It starts with an original vision of the hero, has an inspired cast, creates a self-sufficient story and elevates it with a stylized direction that's in line with the film's substance. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The Batman is an ALL TIME BEST FILM. Matt Reeves has crafted the DEFINITIVE take on The Caped Crusader that Pattinson will define for generations to come. Brooding and brutal, I didn’t want it to end."
The Batman isn’t just another entry in a trilogy or a multi-directed Batman starring three Bruce Wayne’s. It’s a love letter to fans who have waited decades for a faithful adaptation of Batman. 
"This latest Batman tale is grounded, noir and detective based, and a highly realistic entry into the movie mythos of the caped crusader."
"It’s a part-serial killer mystery, part-superhero adventure, and part-crime drama stuffed in a 3-hour runtime that can feel loaded but never dull."
"Not only does the central plot feel like a rehashing of other films and comic books, the entire movie plays like a patchwork quilt of past works."
A phenomenal take on the caped crusader that will leave you wanting more from this Batman world.
"The Batman becomes less of a full-throttle action romp and more of a detective tale, an arc that hasn’t been filmed before. "
"BEST Batman Film yet…. Beautifully made with incredible action sequences, a thrilling mystery, & amazing characters. You can’t get any better than this & wherever smart Reeves goes next door will I."
"With an incredible score by Michael Giacchino, and a backdrop of Nirvana songs to elevate the mood, The Batman is a fantastic film. The acting and fighting sequences will keep audiences on the edge of their seats."
"Matt Reeves delivers a distinctly darker, more intense, frighteningly realistic noir thriller than past adaptations, with an aggressively vengeful Bruce Wayne / Batman and a fear-inducing, mysterious, lunatic Riddler."
"Even with a runtime of nearly three hours, The Batman leaves the audience wanting more. While ultimately fumbling the ending, the characters, performances, plot, and visual appearance leave enough behind to warrant a return to this version of Gotham."
"The Batman is everything a superhero film should be. It’s gritty, stylistic, and most importantly, there’s an intrinsic balance between the action and quiet moments, which Matt Reeves masters superbly through this adaptation."
"In a lot of ways, the disjointed editing in The Batman leaves much for the viewer to process; not enough time exists for key character moments. "
"... In this Batman -- very different from Nolan's, Burton's or Schumacher's -- everything seems more appeased, more contained, more... human. [Full review in Spanish]"
"They turned revealing an antagonist's presence to the audience without the victim's knowledge into a suspense-driven art. Here, Reeves taps directly into these tactics to phenomenal effect..."
This is the ultimate Batman movie.
Batman's superpower has always been that he's the smartest guy in the room. ... His title as the Dark Knight Detective has never been showcased on film as well as it was in The Batman.
"It may take three hours for Bruce to learn this lesson, but it's an incredible three hours. It may be fun to watch Pattinson put on black make-up and strap into the Batsuit to fight some bad guys, but there's much more to this story than just that."
"THE BATMAN exceeds my expectations and passes the bar of a reboot. It justifies its own existence with great storytelling, insights into humanity and human society, and powerful performances. "
"“The Batman” reaches for an ingenious and compelling new way to tell a story about the thin lines between corruption, greed and nobility — but ever so limply and always just out of its grasp."
Good. Dark Moody. He is Batman.
Matt Reeves’ The Batman brings us closest to the essence of the Batman character than any film adapted from the DC comics have since Tim Burton’s inaugural Batman in 1989.
"The Batman is a brave, bold and brilliant new take on a familiar character and Reeves and Pattinson have done him proud."
"Matt Reeves’ The Batman is a brutal, uncompromising vision that leaves its indelible mark in comic book film history."
"The film casts long shadows with blacks and grays, but the consistent, bleeding flashes of red paint the most intense moments with jarring contrast. "
"The Batman is the only comic book adaptation since The Dark Knight to come close to recreating that cinematic achievement, brilliantly blending entertainment with artistry."
"Reeves, it should be noted, assembles a lot of other people’s ideas and themes into this mammoth package. The movie is a triumph of craft and design, but original it ain’t. "
"Reeves’ vision is fresh and innovative, building a young (but not brand new) version of the Bat world that is satisfying as a single film, while planting the seeds for a juggernaut franchise."
The Batman transcends an oversaturated genre and gives arguably the best portrayal of the caped crusader yet. Matt Reeves delivers a slow-burn detective noir with a terrifying villain and ever-rising tension. A rare film that I would call a masterpiece!
"Writer-director Matt Reeves knows how to write a blockbuster with brains, and he knows how to film one with visual flare."
"The way that everything is spliced and shaken together, and the mood — and it's definitely a mood — makes this weighty, heavy, sublimely shot, excellently cast, always-engaging blockbuster feel new, and all things Batman with it."
"THE BATMAN shows that even the best intentions may inspire mayhem, cause heck this is Gotham."
"And even though at times the movie seems a little too male-centric, in times when this is almost prohibited, it felt good to feel those testosterone punches in such a quality, entertaining film. [Full review in Spanish]"
How many times can this story be told? Next time pray that the filmmakers aren’t this self-serious about their own vision and that the running time values your time outside of Gotham.
"Lovers of action, fight sequences, digital effects, and mainstream fare may be driven to mental torture. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Matt Reeves is a director with a vision. I'm glad I enjoy that vision, because Batman needs to have good movies."
It is a victory of story and a failure of plot.
"If they had to do one more go on dark, broody, loner, brutal Batman and they decided the selling point was going to be a push into noir... if it had to happen, this is not a bad result. Actually it's pretty good."
"Do we actually need another brooding Bat-flick of this type? Not really -- a little of Vincent Price prancing around as Egghead would be a welcome sight right about now -- but given its assignment, it mostly gets the job done."
"Operatic, simmering, and replete with a smoky noir atmosphere, The Batman is an enthralling package of contradictions."
"more procedural than action movie, a kind of DC Universe version of Seven (1995)"
"Matt Reeves' The Batman features skillful cinematography, an epic score, and a memorable turn or two from the cast, but it's all undone by a remarkably weak screenplay that ultimately turns the film into a repetitive, unengaging, and over-long slog."
"More than a superhero film –there is little ""super"" about the masked hero– it is a contemporary film noir with touches of absolute terror. [Full review in Spanish]"

"The bigger problem is: the Riddler's menace mostly comes from the Army surplus togs and voice modulation. Otherwise, his demeanor is more like the creepy guy in your sophomore CompLit class who always volunteered to read the Henry Miller excerpts."
"Thanks to Pattinson and Danos compelling performances, as well as Reevess ambitious direction, The Batman is an enthralling thriller and a welcome return for the Caped Crusader."
Matt Reeves The Batman is a riveting and passionately crafted film noir that wears its inspiration on its sleeve while bringing Detective Batman to the big screen.
"hose seeking a grim reflection of our times, will find it; those seeking an escape likely will not. And yet, depressive as it is, the film is electrifying, potent, fun."
Pattinson successfully goes back in time with this character...
"I didn’t think I wanted another Batman movie. But it turns out that Matt Reeves’s The Batman -- starring Robert Pattinson, who played Edward Cullen in the Twilight films -- has the Batman we need."
"Matt Reeves and Robert Pattinson made it look easy to make a new great Batman movie. Greig Fraser, Colin Pharrell and Paul Dano steal the show. The best Gotham out there in a universe full of potential. Full review in Spanish"
"Reeves takes inspiration from numerous comic storylines, mixing and matching to concoct an elaborate tapestry that overflows with iconic characters in differing stages of repute. While not as emotive as his Apes films, the blockbuster spectacle remain."
Always great to see a director with a distinct vision amidst a pool of adaptations. Matt Reeves commits to it and offers a rumination closer to Munich than whacks and pows.
" It doesnt execute every second of its runtime perfectly, but its sense of ambition and drive buoy its entire epic narrative, giving us a reason to get excited about Batman at the movies once again."
"Strange, squalid and sinister, Matt Reeves' version is dark and deadly."
"""The Batman"" offers several great action pieces, but the movie does begin to crumble under its own weight, both in terms of the near-three-hour runtime and its own self-importance. "
"Perhaps the biggest indictment of Gotham City is that even the villains feel a burning need to fight crime and corruption. Sex and sleaze are everywhere, apart from the Batcave, which may as well be a monks cell."
""
"Although Matt Reeves does make attempts to inflect the tired subject matter with some virtuosity, the universe's over-familiarity and essential stodginess overrides any novelty, to my mind, at least."
"Star Pattinson is electric in the role of Batman, expressing so much with his intense silence and reactions to the chaos. "
There's a tactile stickiness to the world that clings to you and immerses you. 
"It's quite possible ""The Batman"" might be too dark and disturbing for some viewers, but I thought it was pretty terrific."
"This new The Batman is a seductive, and gripping detective tale by way of super-heroism. If this is what blockbuster filmmaking in 2022 looks like, then were off to a great start. "
The film I imagine Ricky Fitts would grow up to make after the events of 'American Beauty.'
Matt Reeves’ meandering faux-profound take on Batman spends its over-long runtime telling women to shut up and do as they’re told or face the consequences.
"175 minutes, dark in form and brilliant in execution, that break any labels a preconceived ideas, making the concepto of ""superhero movies"" lose all its meaning despite the masks and capes showing on screen."
"Thrilling from beginning to end, The Batman offers a bleaker spin on Gotham City's beloved hero as he discovers his role in a city just as wounded as him. Full Review in Spanish"
...an above-average comic-book adaptation...
"It verges on camp without committing to it, and it essays the operatic without being able to provide the emotional impetus required."
"Stylish and stark, packed with well-executed action and high-quality performances, The Batman is a welcome addition to the canon of the Caped Crusader. Heres hoping we get to see more of what Reeves, Pattinson and the rest have in mind."
"What this film does achieve, however, is telling a solid new Batman story, one with some pretty compelling twists and a strong point-of-view on who, exactly, the Caped Crusader is. By default, that makes it one of the better Batman movies ever made.

"
"As for special effects, they are very good, and Greig Fraser’s cinematography is epic."
How you like this iteration of Batman may depend upon how you like your serial murderers served and if you like your casting on a binary of Black and White.
"The cast is fine, with Pattinson adding his own touch to a role now undertaken by six different actors in the past 30 years, seven if you go back to Adam West and the original television show of the 1960s.  "
"A beefy, stylised approach and committed performances make this take on the Dark Knight worth a look, even if the film fails to break out of the usual cliched lack of light and colour."
"This is everything I could have asked for in a Batman film. I loved the tone, easter eggs, and so much research that went into this. Bobby Patts brought something different to this character that really stood out. I really loved this film."
This is at least in the top three Batman films of all time for me. It was a combination of all of the best elements of the Batman character and Gotham as a city. It blew me away. This was fantastic. 
The Dark Knight returns with a more hopeful take on vengeance
"This Batman is as dark, depressed and angry as many of those living in these dark, stressful times. Batman wants revenge, while the villain wants to expose government corruption. Thus, the normal superhero story formula is upended."
"The good guy/bad guy duality — opposite sides of the same coin — has been done to death in past Batman movies. In this one, suffice it to say, it’s taken to startling heights.
"
"""... a veritable breath of fresh air in an industry glutted with visually banal superhero films with plots that feel written by committee."""
"Fire of Love is born out of passion. The film’s narration is romantic, merely a reflection of the awe Maurice and Katia have for volcanoes. It’s a love that can be understood by anyone who loves something unbridled adoration."
"The Kraffts brought savoir faire to that most philosophical and visually impressive of science experiments, the leap into the volcano against a backdrop of molten orange."
Viewing Fire of Love could simply inspire feelings of amazement at several places...
"The two love stories woven throughout the narrative—one between Katia and Maurice, the other between the Kraffts and the volcanoes they strove to understand—provide its fiery emotional core."
"Sara Dosa's celebratory portrait expertly weaves together this archive, but is also filled with lovely cinematic touches of its own, from Miranda July's poetic narration to the quirky animated sequences."
"Sara Dosa’s documentary is a celebration of the lives and work of a married team of volcanologists, Katia and Maurice Krafft, who spend years filming and recording volcanic eruptions."
"So much of this doc involves the filmmakers trying to make sense of and figure out who they are only from whatever archival footage they can find. This is exceptional feat to begin with, sorting through all of it..."
It’s also a beautiful love story about two people who shared a passion for exploring and for each other. 
Watching this gave me the weird sensation that the world was a stage for White people and the local non-white people are just background players. The Kraffts died in Japan but no Japanese voices are heard and no Japanese volcanologist died.
Fire of Love is presented in such a way that it feels like an homage to French New Wave films both in its looser structure and in its editing choices.
"This movie serves as a fitting tribute to the lives, careers and legacy of the Kraffts, as well as their love for each other and their dedication to the study of volcanoes. "
"An extremely existential and somewhat fitting statement on how the Kraffts lived, venturing towards the unknown rather than running from it, all experienced in the stunning documentary, Fire of Love."
"Sara Dosa's voice, on the other hand, does not interrupt her function as a second-hand chronicler. One could even say that her informational task sometimes degrades the climax of her images. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Volcanoes are amazing and terrifying. This doc shows that, and the special kind of love it takes to make this your life’s passion with someone else."
"Straying from a purely scientific outlook, Fire of Love reaches an epic spiritual dimension that at times is reminiscent of the great Werner Herzog... [Full review in Spanish]"
...demonstrates a brazen humility.
"Undoubtedly in my top ten films of the year, this is a sublime documentary."
"By telling one of the year’s most compelling love stories, director Sara Dosa’s Fire of Love expands upon the idea of spectacle by showing it as an igniter of passion."
"An astonishing, volcanic relationship..."
"The futuristic outfits and the photography take us through Maurice's refined gaze, showing us the different types of volcanoes, their textures, their environments, and also Katia, and the love with which he observes her. [Full review in Spanish]"
"What an existence Katia and Maurice shared — and what a stunningly compiled and edited tribute this is to them... and the fragility of life, love and, well, everything."
Absolutely jaw-dropping. This is cinema.
Results in a splendid revindication of the quality of amateur scientific cinema capturing nature in its spectacular zenith. [Full review in Spanish]
Transcends the nature documentary. This is something else: way more artistic and interesting. [Full review in Spanish]
"The droning narration nearly killed the film for me but others might like it. The images are spectacular, sublime, astonishing and terrifying, and they raise meaty questions."
"The wonders of drone technology have taken much of the risk out of filming angry volcanoes and now produce incredible images not even the Kraffts could have envisioned, making the chances they took and the footage they shot all the more astounding.      "
"Also a film about love. About the love that burns like fire, of course, but also that other love that the cinema tells us less about . [Full review in Spanish]"
"It's a little light on actual science, but Dosa goes big on the Nietzschean romance of the couple without ever penetrating the roots of their obsession; they have the glazed fixity of all true obsessives. "
"A visually stunning, emotionally evocative documentary."
"Fire of Love reminds us that they are also art of the highest order, a demand on our minds and hearts to pay attention, maybe especially to that which we cannot easily understand."
What emerges over the course of Fire of Love is a profound meditation on the miraculous melding of kindred spirits who ignited one another’s passion and balanced each other’s strengths.
"...has that same sense of playfulness but also wants to explore [Katia and Maurice's] obsession, their willingness to face danger."
This may be your closest experience of nature at its most majestic and devastatingly powerful.
"When it lets nature speak for itself, the results are endlessly gripping. The ferociousness of reality ultimately buoys the film when its central conceit of a love story for the ages struggles to be more than an intriguing set-up."
"Not just a movie, it’s an experience that instantly grabs your attention and won’t let go, taking us to the edge of nature’s fiercest force and its paradoxical function of creation through destruction."
"A movie about people who figuratively and literally burn for each other (you hear that, Bridgerton fans?), Fire of Love is a nonfiction rarity: a documentary that can also serve as one romantic-ass date movie."
The uneasy psychological undertow mixed with the stunning volcano footage and archive clips makes this a journey into a rare form of grail-hunting madness.
Much of the imagery is so astonishing that it leaves us gasping for breath. But it's the likeable couple at the centre that holds the interest.
"A bittersweet ode to two passionate minds, a spectacular showcase of footage from the natural wonders of the world and a life-affirming experience on striving for your dreams, Fire of Love is an emotionally stirring and whimsically presented documentary."
"It succeeds in highlighting this tenet of their work, making it a valuable introduction not just to their unique lives and groundbreaking studies, but also to their own singular artistry."
Seeing the ash plume unfold in the shape of a mushroom cloud 40 kilometres high -- beautiful but deadly -- is awe inspiring. But Dosa undercuts the raw power of such glorious moments with hideous sentimentality.
"The delivery wavers, & at times it’s difficult to decide if these two are courageous or foolhardy, but even so, Fire of Love is a remarkable story. Most importantly, it highlights the bravery of those who help us understand the power of the natural world."
"A story of love and discovery told with curiosity and care, Dosa honours her unique subjects — lending tenderness and poetry to the archive footage."
Gorgeously shot. A love story that works on multiple levels. Not sure if the narration was entirely necessary but that's a minor quibble when everything else is emotionally resonant and engaging throughout.
"The film’s approach skirts around the actual science of the Kraffts’ work, but it does explore the psychology of a shared passion..."
"Sara Dosa’s documentary might not make you fully care for its doomed lovers, but she more than compensates for it by inserting some of the most astonishing volcano imagery every put on film. "
[Maurice and Katia Krafft] managed to shoot spectacular footage of lava flows and volcanic cores. That footage forms the basis of this remarkable documentary.
Centering their grim fate allows a more complex reading of their lives and choices. Were they quasi-heroic explorers? Adrenaline junkies who loved silly hats? Reckless fame seekers? Hopeless romantics? Excessively French?
"[Sara Dosa] has crafted a sensitive narration, softly whispered by her fellow film-maker Miranda July, that dares to ask huge questions about love and relationships in the face of imminent death. "
Dosa grounds Fire of Love’s awesome Romantic portraiture in a narrative that is perhaps more mundane but no less gripping for it. 
"It's possible to admire their ability to simplify, even as we instinctively recoil from the tremendous risks they took in the process."
Celebrity volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft's... love couldn’t have been more Shakespearean.
"A story of romance, between two people, and between the couple and the beautiful and terrible power of nature."
[A] fascinating documentary about the daring duo who transformed our knowledge of nature’s most destructive forces.
Sara Dosa’s documentary about renowned French volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft has tons of eye-popping footage of flowing rivers of boiling lava and bellowing volcanos. It’s “wow” with a capital W.
"Because of the overwhelming grandeur and fearful splendor of the many volcanoes this couple visited and photographed, watching this film on the big screen is a must."
A gripping documentary about a French couple united by their love of the world's most dangerous volcanoes and each other.
"Purely spectacular as it is, Fire of Love is also a riveting film about film: a salute to the power of the Kraffts’ canny, witty images."
"Fire of Love may not make profound sense of this demise, or probe into their relationship much at all, but as a broad-brush rendering of the Kraffts’ lifelong quest, it has a coffee-table allure that’s undeniably ravishing."
A portrait of two people who were equally and obsessively single-minded in their life’s pursuit... that is the heart of Fire of Love. 
"It’s content to nod and stare and keep an admiring distance. With lava flows and ash plumes, that’s an understandable response and works fine. With a pair of individuals as unusual as the Kraffts, it’s not and it doesn’t."
"A romance forged by and ultimately destroyed by passion, Dosa’s Fire of Love is one of those rare documentaries that arrives once or twice a decade to leave audiences awe-struck by its wonder and terrors. It is the Grizzly Man of volcanoes."
You say you've been on some crazy dates? You may want to rethink that when you watch Fire of Love...
"... The film has an elegiac quality, one that's beautifully and thrillingly reinforced by the majesty of everything they [Katia and Maurice Krafft] documented."
"... This film looks for something romantic, celebrating or consecrating the myth of the Kraffts: they loved each other, they loved volcanoes and it all came together on that terrible day. "
A hypnotic and poetic documentary that explores the deepest mysteries of nature and love in Earth's most dangerous corners. [Full Review in Spanish]
"""...archival footage is exciting enough, but editors...make judicious use of split-screen, circular stencils and other visual effects, varying the rhythm just enough to make this world seem even more magical."""
"Dosa’s film is a slick, moving and cutely Herzogian portrait of this loving, monomaniacal couple who straddled the line between the eccentric and the earnest."
"Dosa infuses her story with a dash of the mythic, honoring her subjects who came to see volcanoes in mythic terms despite being rigorous scientists."
"There’s something supernaturally hypnotic about watching lava flow, watching ash and flame explode from the surface of the Earth, watching two tiny little people with gigantic spirits reveling in the majesty of mother nature’s power."
The images of walls of fire crashing down with the force of Niagara Falls or exploding into rocks underwater is reason enough to witness Fire Of Love.
"Not only did they throw themselves into their work, but they took copious photographs and movies of the volcanoes they studied, which makes Dosa’s film not just a poetic love story, but a feast for the senses."
Werner Herzog got there first. And what is with Miranda July's weak narration? But this a unique love story with striking visuals. 
The volcanologists are fascinating but I never felt like I got to know the couple. I should have.
"The result is more than a mere nature documentary. It is one of the most moving and mesmerizing films of the year, a meditation on the wonders of nature and human curiosity."
Director Sara Dosa finds poetry in the love affair between volcanologists  the Kraffts and their scientific obsession with volcanoes.
Fire of Love brings us as close to the beauty and horror of these natural wonders as a film ever could.
"Fire of Love is not just a nature documentary, it’s something more. It’s a character driven film with stirring images best seen on the big screen of a movie theatre, about the nature of passion."
It’s a film begging for big-screen beholding.
"The filmmaker isn’t so much interested in telling us about the Kraffts or even about the little-understood science of volcanology, but in creating a low-key twee mood that edges past cute straight into grating."
"Maurice voices a fateful philosophy, one which would catch up to them on Japan’s Mount Unzen, an event when finally told comes across as anticlimactic due to July’s monotonous reading, an enervation Dosa’s selected footage mostly overcomes."
"Every year, there are at least one or two extraordinary don't-miss-it documentaries. Fire of Love certainly qualifies as an entry for 2022. "
"...with its endlessly entrancing footage of magma exploding and flowing against the shifting background of a wall of smoke, it’s a documentary about how the recorded image is so powerful, some have even died for it."
"Two French lovers swirl the world in search of fire and one day, die together in the gushing molten surge of a volcanic eruption. Goodnight folks, that’s the summary of tonight’s feature, <I>Fire of Love</I>."
"The way Dosa shapes the story, emphasizing the couple’s deep love for each other and their unconventional lives, is what makes “Fire of Love” ... one of the most moving and memorable films of 2022."
This is one of the most endearing love stories we've seen in film in a long time. 
It is spectacular. You have to see it in a theater to experience the enormity of it. 
"The film percolates with a love of movies, specifically the French New Wave; at its best moments it feels like Breathless, if Jean-Paul Belmondo’s character had been obsessed with volcanologists instead of Humphrey Bogart.   "
"A movie which captures the overlapping unpredictability and ineffable beauty of both volcanoes and human bonds, and the unknown length of fuse which each ultimately possess."
"A 90-minute documentary about lava? What is this, geology class? Not even close... Fire of Love is a cool, sensual and visceral experience that thrusts you into an inferno of romance. "
"A delightful documentary, but also seemingly an origin story for Wes Anderson's entire aesthetic."
... incorporates an impressive collection of photographs and archival footage so vivid you can practically feel the heat.
"Filled with breathtaking footage and making use of skillful editing, tranquil, thoughtful music, and gorgeously poetic narration, this documentary merges science, nature, and romance. "
"The film is one of the year’s few awe-inspiring documentaries -- a visually ravishing record, a bustling adventure, and an engrossing character study that begs to be remade, with actors, as a big-budget Hollywood narrative feature. "
"A dazzling, seductive, nature-meets-romance documentary that cuts against the current grain for nonfiction films."
A singular and sublime new documentary about the couple that risks the sentimental in order to realize the truly romantic.
The doc is a capsule history lesson on an eons-old natural phenomenon. But it’s also the greatest lava-fueled love story ever told.
"It's hard to find someone to spend our lives with let alone one who shares the same passion. Armed with explosive materials accompanied by lyrical collages, Dosa accentuates the story of two lovers who shared the same passion and lived and died together. "
"Dosa’s film is confident in its imprecision, comfortable riding various visual and philosophical waves to appealingly exploratory rather than conclusionary ends. And so it’s baffling ... that all this is guided by Miranda July’s unfortunate voiceover."
"[A] thrilling, moving documentary..."
Marcel the Shell with Shoes On has a simple plot but a character that overcomes the fear of loneliness. It’s a universal feeling that will surely resonate with viewers.
The way director Dean Fleischer Camp mixes stop-motion animation and live action filmmaking is matched by the storytelling’s fusion -- everything gels delightfully.
A simple but beautiful film about appreciating the little things in life. + Hilarious along the way! A24 has its first family feature & it’s a HIT!
"There’s a lot for a one-inch shell to be afraid of. It’s easy to make excuses and turn down opportunities that scare us, and it’s easy to stay in the world that we know, but humanity is at its best when we are brave."
"The movie captures how instantaneously something can catch fire on the internet, but ""Marcel the Shell with Shoes On"" is deeper than a profile in viral fame."
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On tugs at all the right heartstrings, creating a perfect life-affirming film that can be enjoyed by all generations of the family."
"This absurd tale of friendship and mortality is a whimsical yet wise joy, tinged with melancholy."
"A heartwarming, hilarious, poignant, and life-affirming story about a mystical shell."
"A handcrafted oddity miniature but profound, like its title hero."
The movie triumphs in recuperating a lost innocence and in getting rid of any kind of cynicism. [Full review in Spanish]
"I wasn’t ready to have my soul squelched by the sweet adventures of an anthropomorphic exoskeleton. Yet this gorgeous animation delivers more than a few profound statements about life, community and family."
"It's buoyantly funny, endearing and wonderfully surreal, conjuring plenty of Borrowers-esque magic out of Marcel and Connie's escapades. "
"The film sometimes comes close to excessive cutesiness, but quiet wit and visual brilliance more than save it."
"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On delivers a funny and extraordinarily profound story that, though populated by weird little one-eyed seashells in sneakers, is as human as anything you’re likely to encounter. A gorgeous, life-affirming film."
"Bite-sized pearls of wisdom and wonderment from everyone's favourite YouTube crustacean sensation make an elegant shuffle, frequent leaps and occasional tumbles from the internet to the big screen."
"Marcel The Shell With Shoes on has an earnest quality that will win over viewers of all ages, that makes you feel good without an overabundance of treacle."
"A joyous juxtaposition of quotidian, vérité-style dialogue and fancifully inventive visuals that hits a tragicomic sweet spot."
"Charming animated tale of a bereft one-inch shell overdoes the sentiment.
"
"Marcel the Shell could so easily have been irritating, and does lapse into sentimentality at times, but it achieves remarkable depths of emotion, and has much to say about the meaning and importance of family."
"No emotion is forced, but, as we move towards a touching denouement, even Teflon psyches will find themselves opening up to the oddest of outsiders."
"The film is deftly done, unexpectedly moving and with a dash of Tony-Hart-and-Morph energy balanced by Zen ruminations on the interconnectedness of all things."
"For the opening half hour or so, I feared this hand-crafted oddity could become insufferably twee. But after a while, I stopped admiring the animation and was completely taken in by the characters."
"…If you only see one film about a mollusc this year, Marcel The Shell With Shoes on is the only show in town when it comes to snail tales…"
"The animation, by the New York-based Chiodo brothers, is both witty in its make-do-and-mend aesthetic (the sentient Shreddies are a hoot) and sometimes dazzlingly intuitive. You don’t question the truth of it for a moment..."
"... if you had told me I’d be moved to tears by the musings of a one-inch talking shell, I would have been concerned. And yet, I was. Because sometimes the best things do come in small packages."
"Ultimately, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, hits home in its comical and tender handling of collective grief and hope; something we can all relate to in the aftermath of a global lockdown."
How Marcel copes with this shell-cracking stress forms a beautiful final act that’s tender but never twee thanks to adept comic timing and playful use of scale.
"Delicate, yet resonant."
"For a slight, ninety-minute stop-motion animated movie to grapple with something like grief, community, and family and to do it so well, to so keenly observe all of that, is something special."
"This feel-good animated gem is one of the most delightful, most creative surprises of the year, introducing audiences to an utterly charming title character — voiced to perfection by Jenny Slate — who, like the film itself, is impossible not to love."
It takes an effort of will to remember that Marcel doesn’t exist. He’s not big enough to hug … but I sort of felt like it.
Further proof that YouTube characters seldom translate into feature length efforts.
"Funny, profound, weird, sad, and gorgeously constructed — Marcel is a true original, liable to melt even the most cynical heart."
"Marcel is cute, but it needs to be more. The effort is clearly there and Marcel is a kind film about universal themes. "
"... hilarious, sometimes dangerous, and always fascinating, a unique life outlook that doesn’t pull any punches... Rossellini’s tone and subtle digs as Connie is masterful voice work... it’s hard not to smile at the way a one-eyed shell sees the world."
The puppetry here is brilliantly done.
"More than anything, it’s a film about joy: joy in family, joy in friendship, and joy in the many wonders of life we often miss. "
"Sweet, endearing, happily silly, often hilarious and deeply insightful movie... an all-round gem."
"[The filmmakers] try to make everything so charming and adorable that, at times, this compulsion to ALWAYS be liked slightly works against the film. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Not really about the plot but just about being in the presence of the characters, in a filmmaking style that elicits a gentle and innocent response... Felt like I had a warm blanket around me. This is something the world needs right now. "
"The element of sorrow mixed in with all the whimsy feels genuine enough. And as a diversion for patient and soft-hearted children, and for adults willing to shelve their cynicism for 90 minutes,""Marcel"" even at face value has a certain wispy charm."
"There's this ventriloquist dynamic between Marcel and Dean that is impossible to not sense. Everyone of us has been Marcel at one point of our lives, with a personality so big that it does not fit our tiny bodies. Beautiful film. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Its a film about a loss soul, finding  your place, it has darkness and deals with death and grief... I adored this."
Marcel The Shell With Shoes On is so wholesome and pure with some truly laugh out loud moments of humor and sweetness.
By focusing its gentle humour and storytelling pathos on that deceptively simple message - that just being “good” is enough in a huge and often meaningless existence - the Marcel movie stands far taller than its weeny protagonist.
"Enlivened by its adorable repurposing of household objects – sliced bread is a mattress, stray lint is a pet dog, tennis balls are cars – the film is cute without ever being cutesy."
"The movie offers 90 minutes of poignant whimsy, all of it inducing genuine laughter and tears. If it doesn’t move you, I fear nothing will."

"As much as this is a comedy, it’s an emotionally cathartic tearjerker about loss, change and maturity."
"If this sounds like a mixed bag review, have a raisin, because it is. There’s a lot I enjoyed. I was engaged by the story and a tiny bit frustrated by Marcel. I realize my tolerance for wee voices and a million questions is as shallow as sweat in a pore."
It’s a surprisingly touching and heartfelt movie that will appeal to older kids and adults.
Marcel the Shell with Shoes On imagines an alternative world where characters and stories are born of sheer creativity and not recycled ideas based on selling children's toys. 
An adorable little film with big life-lessons.
"It's safe to say you've never seen anything like Marcel the Shell with Shoes On before, but you'll be glad you did."
"Camp and Slate have the experience of viral frame and the distance from that experience to offer perspectives like, “It’s an audience, it’s not a community.”"
"This movie feels like a warm hug in all the right ways. Truly uplifting, hilarious, compassionate. "
"‘Marcel’ could be described as a ‘Garfield’ and ‘Fantastic Mr. Fox’ combination that gently rolls around and splashes in pools of honey, marmalade, and frank, observational discourse, but the said explanation doesn’t do this endearing film justice."
"Marcel is the kind of film that I suspect Jim Henson would have loved: It's childlike, playful, hopeful and wise — and all of this without ever stooping to sentimentality. "
"He’s a heartwarming and resonant character, and this is a delightful little film.  "
"It’s a different kind of animated adventure, to be sure, impressively done via stop-motion."
"Somewhere, I suppose, there's a critic working up a venomous pan of this animated feature, based on the viral 2010 online short and its sequels. But I'm not that critic."
"The performance of Slate, the excellent animation, and the uncynical storytelling makes Marcel the Shell with Shoes On the perfect balm in a summer dominated by blockbusters."
"Adorable and almost relentlessly heartwarming, Marcel the Shell With Shoes On is some thoughtful all-ages fare that’ll win over the kids and their parents. "
Till is an unmissable film and a humanist work par excellence; no one should look away.
Danielle Deadwyler turns in the most emotional & astonishing performance of 2022. My heart is truly speechless from her performance…
Till is a cut above most historical biopics. 
"Chukwu and cinematographer Bobby Bukowski can barely bring themselves to peer away from Deadwyler, who stuns in frame after frame."
"Told from the perspective of a mother's love, the story of a lynching that galvanised the 1960s civil rights protests has dignity and raw emotive power"
"The screenplay, by the director in collaboration with Michael Reilly and Keith Beauchamp, is filled with rich detail, such as the different ways in which attendees at the trial are treated according to their colour."
"Till distinguishes itself with the intimacy of its approach. As well as possessing a luminous beauty made for close-ups, Deadwyler, displays a deep understanding of Mamie’s grief and her urge to make her son’s memory stand for something."
"As a grieving Mamie Till, Danielle Deadwyler takes immersive ownership of a mother’s primal pain."
"It may not be an easy watch, but it’s essential; and, if nothing else, Deadwyler’s performance will floor you to where the story’s personal relevance won’t be of issue."
"As well-intentioned as it is, Till becomes consumed with its own self-righteousness as it goes from being a moving drama to a strident, obvious and rather drab polemic...the film gradually loses its grip on what could have been a compelling narrative."
"[The] script doesn’t escape the stiffness common in history lessons, but Deadwyler’s immersion in Mamie’s agony is utterly convincing. "
"The theme is moving, but the way it's told is hardly brilliant. [Full review in Spanish]"
It's as impactful as it is insipid. And that's the worst thing that can happen to a biopic. [Full review in Spanish]
Till is an unflinching critique of the assertion to always “believe women.”
"A necessary story, a missed opportunity. [Full review in Spanish] "
The focus of this director is on the fight of Mamie Bradley. [Full review in Spanish] 
"Infused with an incredible performance from Danielle Deadwyler, ‘Till’ takes great care in depicting the murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till and his mother’s fight to make the world witness what happened to him."
"It’s a courageous movie that gathers strength as it ages, with the tone producing an eerily horror effect that doesn’t lift for most of the movie. Deadwyler stuns in a role that could have been chewed up. She digs in. "
A searing civil rights drama that is as beautiful as it is heartbreaking — and as difficult to watch at times as it feels necessary.
Documents like this film contribute to the education about racism and its new forms. [Full review in Spanish]
"There is enough here in craft to emphasise Chukwu’s gifts. Even when the language of the film feels too knowing or on the nose, Till also feels actively engaged in thinking through dynamics of how history plays out on film."
"Danielle Deadwyler delivers an outstanding performance as Mamie, reflecting the character’s emotional journey."
"Till isn’t easy to watch, it’s not meant to be. But it is required viewing."
[This] bold depiction of the events broils with a fury that lays to rest any concerns of a dull-but-worthy affair
"A sensational acting showcase for Deadwyler, as Mamie shifts from devastated mother to reluctant activist."
It's a movie that makes you feel good when it should make you feel lousy.
"Till treats the spectacle of pain with respect, and makes the case for its power to build solidarity and enact change."
It's an unusual historical drama that manages to be both deeply moving and hugely inspirational without ever giving into sentiment.
…Danielle Deadwyler’s huge leading performance should ensure that Till has a permanent shelf-life as a record of the agony that racism can create…
"These and other events are capably captured in Chukwu’s compassionate biographical drama that, though not without its flaws, stays with you long after the credits roll."
"Chukwu prefers humans to saints and fluid film-making is her thing.
"
"Chinonye Chukwu, working with a talented and mostly flawless cast, has established the film’s venomously racist Jim Crow-era milieu so profoundly that the exchange bristles with shock and sickening dread. "
"‘He came home to me reeking of racial hatred,’ carries the click of a screenwriter’s keyboard, not the ring of authentic dialogue. Never mind. This is a powerful film..."
"Danielle Deadwyler’s performance puts you in the shoes of Mamie, before, during and after the lynching of her son by white supremacists and it’s a very moving place to be."
Chukwu doesn’t compromise the narrative for sentimentality...Till is a brutally honest portrayal of American racism and the moving portrait of a woman whose pain drove her to help others.
Chukwu asks us to look beyond individual legal outcomes and see the bigger picture – to take strength from tragedy and find hope even in despair.
"Against the distress, Chukwu and Deadwyler find purpose in Mamie’s transformation into a hugely influential civil rights activist. This is a woman’s account of striving for racial justice."
Till is a tough watch but a strong reminder of the vital contribution black women played in the civil rights movement and in bringing the racist crimes to public awareness.
Till honours something more important: the power of a picture that speaks the truth.
A grim film but an important one.
"Till is a compelling, unflinching, poignant but insightful account .. Chukwu skilfully interweaves a delicate balance between the pain and anguish ... and the sentiments of familial joy ... powerful storytelling"
"... An absorbing, slow-burning study of a broken woman’s politicisation. She is superbly served by star Danielle Deadwyler, who transforms Till from a good film into a gripping one."
"Without downplaying the violence of the social system in which this story takes place, Chukwu also takes care to celebrate the love within the extended Till family and the beauty of the Southern landscape."
"Well worth your time, especially if this story is a blind spot."
Till is a fierce portrait of courage and a sombre study of the human cost involved in resisting this kind of barbarity.
There are none of the big set piece speeches traditionally associated with winning awards. Instead we are presented with something which feels much more raw and natural.
"A detailed portrait of a political awakening through pain, one built around Mamie’s realisation that the racism she’s internalised as an independent city dwelling woman who’s fled the South can’t be buried or ignored..."
"It isn’t a comfortable watch. Nor should it be. By the end, you may feel ashamed of the colour of your own skin, but it’s an essential film, telling a story that continues to reverberate with both dignity and an insistence on being heard and seen. "
[Danielle] Deadwyler's pain is palpable.
Chinonye Chukwu's film leads with good intentions and dives into the roots of a mother's pain in order to build a heartbreaking epic that has no intention of concealing its militant message. [Full review in Spanish]
"Is a very hard film to watch, but it has one of the Best Female performance of 2022 from Danielle Deadwyler! The storytelling, the history, the acting, cinematography, one of the best scores this year & such a powerful telling of the Mother of Emmett Till"
"Till is a must see for many reasons, but it is Deadwyler’s quiet, controlled and luminous performance that balances the horror and magnitude of the story."
Till only thrives as a dramatic experience when Deadwyler is activated and humanizing it (which is thankfully much of the picture). 
"The Nigerian-born director is totally committed to her subject, but I’m convinced that the power of the film doesn’t totally match the power of the message."
"The screenplay, by Michael Reilly, Keith Beauchamp and Chinonye Chukwu is taut and powerful. Writer-Director Chinonye Chukwu keeps the story simple and direct, avoiding the kinds of clutter and side issues that sometimes creep into historical dramas. "
"An emotional and harrowing experience, anchored by Deadwyler's incredible performance — quite a revelation. Full review in Spanish."
"Chukwu is intentionally centering the Black experience with every frame. We need only see the pain inflicted and the strength to endure it. Just like Mamie with her son's body, TILL ensures we cannot look away."
"Doubtlessly, this will be the first time many viewers learn anything about Emmett Till. But it’s better late than never when it comes to this accessible film."
"Till is truly a gigantic opportunity for any professional, and Deadwyler has embraced it tooth and nail. [Full review in Spanish] "
The historical drama rises to a greater height because of the spirited Oscar type of performance by Deadwyler.
"It’s tough to watch, but a must-see. 
It’s cinematic history.
"
Inspiring and touching story of a Black mother whose bearing witness catalyzed the civil rights movement.
"For Chukwu, Till is another victory, even if it can’t quite match Clemency in power. "
Danielle Deadwyler is the heart and soul of this remarkable film.
It is an honest depiction of an American tragedy. It forces us to remember a time that many would prefer to forget.
"The filmmakers are incapable of calling on the strongest dramatic forms, of drawing on the noblest ideas—above all, they are not interested in making a universal appeal."
A reminder about a ghastly part of American history. 
An emotionally relentless story about a mother’s strength in the aftermath of an unspeakable tragedy. It carries with it a message that continues to resonate to this day.
" Next to Cate Blanchett’s remarkable incarnation of an egomaniacal conductor in Tár, Deadwyler delivers the most essential and critical performance in a film this year."
Till really belongs to actress Danielle Deadwyler.
"This is a difficult film to watch because you share in the grief of a mother and an entire group of people, but it is a necessary story that needs to be told."
"There’s no happy ending, but Till does end with a sense of hope. The murder of Emmett Till changed the way many Americans looked at race. At one point, Mamie asks God why this happened. By the end, we feel that through one boy’s death others might live."
What is astounding about Chinonye Chukwu’s direction of Till is that so many different movie genres seem to be expertly woven together into one story.
"She's [Danielle Deadwyler] got something, and it's on full display in this film. "
"A powerful and riveting bio-drama that brings a thoughtful approach to its subject matter with integrity and love.

"
"An impassioned melodrama on the surface, unafraid of facing tragedy head-on and allowing ample space for grief, anger, and fear, but which is also a wise movie about the complicatedly political world Mamie Till finds herself in."
"The film's feel and nobility is more through a filter of today than the actual 1950s, but it must be told, because the murderer motives still exist today. Passionate performances, especially from Danielle Deadwyler as Mamie Till-Mobley. Essential."
There’s no denying the sense of loss and will that Deadwyler’s performance makes so vivid...
Equally tough and restrained...
"Danielle Deadwyler as Emmett Till's Mother in ""Till"" is a powerhouse performance for the ages. ""Till"" is engrossing, enraging, heart-wrenching and poignant. ""Till"" will stay with you forever."
"It may seem like a small thing, but scenes that allow Mamie to be in full focus have a much harder impact because of very deliberate camera choices."
"Till manages to avoid feeling overly reliant on the violence behind this brutal act. Instead, the focus is on the emotions that come from this tragedy, the fallout of this event, and the remarkable performance from Danielle Deadwyler."
"One of the most moving, and ultimately inspiring, movies about the Civil Rights Movement. "
"Unquestionably memorable, Till breaks the traditional biopic mold through perspective and persistence by way of a mother’s journey."
"Deadwyler deserves an Oscar nomination, at the very least, for her portrayal of Mamie Till."
"The film is emotionally engaging as we watch Deadwyler masterfully go through several transformations in the film, from worrying parent to grieving mother to determined civil rights advocate."
Danielle Deadwyler gives the breakout performance of the year as a Black activist mother who used the 1955 lynching of her son Emmett Till to galvanize the civil-rights movement. Chinonye Chukwu crafts this emotional powerhouse into essential viewing.
"""Till"" spares us the visual horror of Emmett's murder, but the pain of his death is felt in every single frame and in the emotionally raw and revelatory performance of Danielle Deadwyler, whose name should be on every awards season ballot."
"While the dramatic pacing is conventional to a fault, “Till” is a wrenching portrait of grief as well as a sobering history lesson."
Get ready to ugly cry ... 'Till' is a gut punch ... Deadwyler nails it every time. 
Deadwyler is impressive and her dedication and eloquence in this role does justice to Chukwu’s script and to the memory of Emmett Till.
"Till is a powerful movie. Its strength rises not just from the story of racism it tells, for the background story has been told often, and not just from its unique perspective, but also from its stunning presentation in film form."
Danielle Deadwyler was new to me when I saw her in Till. Her performance as Emmett Till’s mother is everything for this conscientious-to-a-fault drama.
"Compelling and absolutely heartbreaking, with a terrific star-making turn for Danielle Deadwyler. "
What distinguishes Till from most other well-intentioned films telling similarly themed stories set during this tumultuous era of American history is the absence of white saviors. 
"Deadwyler is hypnotic, a formidable presence as a woman who endures the unendurable and then alters history."
The story of Till cannot be told without the incredible performance from Deadwyler. She delivers an instantly classic performance that hammers home the emotion. The raw vulnerability on display cannot be forgotten after you leave the theater.
"In creating this visceral picture, Deadwyler anchors moments of defiance and activism with scenes where the loss of her son is immeasurable. Those fluctuating qualities make it one of the best acting performances this year."
It’s but one aspect of Deadwyler’s performance which is such that “powerful” is an insufficient term to describe it.
An engrossing Civil Rights drama that could turn its little-known star into an Oscar winner.
"The Woman King achieves cinematic royalty with its extremely skillful, well-crafted, and purposeful picture that tells a narrative of empowerment and humanity. It’s well-crafted from start to finish, with Davis shining in the starring role."
"writer Dana Stevens, story contributor Maria Bello – more known for her acting (“A History of Violence”) – and Prince-Bythewood continue an emerging cinematic trend of alternate, redemptive histories that bend toward utopianism"
Davis elevates this standard story with the emotion and dire she brings to her performance.
"For viewers who choose to focus on the adrenaline rush of the feminist warriors ready to challenge the patriarchy, The Woman King proudly wears its crown."
"Thuso Mbedu delivers one of the best feature film debut performances I've ever witnessed. The anti-slavery, anti-racism and equal human rights messages are well conveyed, but the authentic, emotionally resonant character dynamics stand out."
"While this is undoubtedly Viola Davis at her finest, the movie's breakout star is Thuso Mbedu as Nawi. It may be called The Woman King, but it's Mbedu that steals the spotlight in every frame."
"An instant classic, Viola Davis slays as always. Lashana Lynch is incredible, Sheila Atim is amazing, & Thuso Mbedu steals the show as the heart/soul of the entire film! Blythewood created an epic that we don’t see anymore from Hollywood."
"Despite stumbles in terms of plot and pacing, The Woman King is a thrilling watch. This story, these women, and the film’s heart deserve to be seen on the biggest screen possible with an audience ready to go along for a wild ride."
The movie fails to fulfil its potential except as a military action epic.
"A dazzler from Terence Blanchard’s symphonic score to Polly Morgan’s eye pleasing cinematography. Acting is A-1, particularly by Davis and Mbedu. 
"
"Viola Davis is a force unleashed, heading up a full-blooded tale of conflict set against the backdrop of the slave trade that offers both a twist on the traditional male-dominated warrior-epic and a look at a part of history Hollywood typically ignores"
Its the emotional sparring between the women - as fierce as anything on the battle ground - that really holds the attention
"If it had been a story about white people, it would have been a snore. But we have rarely, if ever, seen a movie quite like this one about powerful Black women, and the energy onscreen is infectious."
"…goes all in as a popular entertainment, rolling back the male-dominance of the action genre and replacing it with something smart, dynamic and female driven…"
"As these women take their place in the kingdom of Dahomey and assert their power, The Woman King truly takes on new meaning, and finds relevance in the modern era."
"The film is shot impeccably well, scored passionately, and gives the viewer something to savor as they leave the theater. "
It's not a perfect film but acting-wise - this is a masterclass. Pacing was tight and effective despite lacking in some character development. This is a really good film.
"The performances, action scenes and cinematography were fantastic. I think the representation of bad ass black women was incredible."
"Pacing issues and historical inaccuracies aside, The Woman King has great action and moving characters brought to life by a fantastic ensemble cast."
A giddy mix of history and fantasy.
"...as a piece of entertainment, The Woman King works very well. The action is extremely well-staged and is visceral and brutal and endlessly fun. "
"A wildly watchable and compelling movie, one of 2022's best popcorn films."
"Between the historical African ballad and the feminist epic, The Woman King advances unspectacularly academic, annoyingly predictable, and blatantly contrived."
"Gina Prince-Bythewood’s film offers all the pleasures of an old-school epic but with a fresh take—the heroes in this film are Black women, led by Viola Davis in an inspiring performance as the military leader Nanisca. "
"The Woman King is a powerful film with Viola Davis playing and incredible lead. 

The dedication and craft put into this film is evident with strong performances and thoughtful moments."
"Gina Prince-Bythewood directs the best battle epic since “Braveheart” and “Gladiator."" It's that good, applying a diverse cast to good old-fashioned spectacle storytelling. Is it revisionist history? Of course, but it's still the best movie of the year."
"Gina Prince-Bythewood’s action flick stars a number of young actresses joining the ranks of Agojie, but Mbedu really kills it with plenty of stunts and an emotional tale of mothers and daughters."
"The Woman King is one of the best films of 2022! Viola Davis commands this film with her presence of power & emotional grace. Every other cast member are just as powerful & engaging. Amazing dedication to scripting, choreography, stunt work, & directing"
"Films often elect spectacle or substance. To its credit, The Woman King offers both in a rousing tale of women warriors while mounting a devastating historical and cultural critique."
A rousing saga.
"Poignant, proud, and powerful. What is remarkable is that this story has never been told in such magnitude and is a feat worthy of all the history books.  The strength in combat matched the strength in will.  "
"Viola Davis has her second-best role to date (love Ma Rainey) as Nanisca, the kick-ass and fearless leader. Lashana Lynch kills (literally and figuratively) as Nanisca's loyal lieutenant. "
"I applaud the femme-focus of “The Woman King” and its depiction of strong-willed, strong-bodied women who earned their place of power. "
"But the main selling point of The Woman King is its performances, with Davis and John Boyega standing out as especially phenomenal in this film."
"An epic story that gets lost in an uneven and bloated film encumbered by subplots that lead nowhere. Fortunately, the collection of misfires doesn't get in the way of enjoying this old-fashioned production... [Full review in Spanish]"
"The film is more notable for the story it tells rather than how it tells it, with numerous action and fight sequences that are as precise as they're devoid of personality... [Full review in Spanish]"
"'The Woman King' artfully and seamlessly blends some familiar movie genres — following in the tradition of big-screen sagas like Gladiator, Braveheart, and Last of the Mohicans — with a fresh female perspective. And, Viola Davis rules!"
"It does not seek to question masculinity, but limits itself to replacing the Leonids on duty with hypermasculinized women.  [Full review in Spanish]"
"For all its formulaic plotting and pedestrian dialogue, The Woman King is fresh in every other way: Its visual palette, its setting and art direction, its voice and perspective. It’s as beautiful to look at as it is tonally fierce – as it is predictable"
"Prince-Bythewood’s achievement is urgent, brilliant filmmaking and Davis’s performance is bound to become iconic. "
“Inspired by real historical events” means in Hollywood-speak: “A grain of truth in a bed of fiction and fantasy”                                                                                                                                      
"Not that they have to here, but the phenomenal quartet that is Davis, Lynch, Mbedu and Atim could lift any material."
"Just a good-old-fashioned swords-and-sandals epic told with a fresh, diverse spin. Viola Davis is a cannonball in this, which is the most interesting/best performance she’s given since Fences."
"The Woman King is a genuine crowd-pleaser that delivers grand entertainment in terms of blockbuster scale, punchy set-pieces and a formidable cast. Highly recommended."
"Set against a dark backstory, this exhilarating tale of Amazon women, brimming with female energy, has more going for it than most superhero flicks"
"In this sisterhood of soldiers there’s more empathy.  It’s not that they're weak, but that they understand the price of being strong.  
"
"A wholly exciting feature that overcomes any conventionality with its fierce female spirit, and that’s more than enough to warrant a passionate celebration."
"The dialogue is generic -- the formal kind constructed to suit all periods -- but the actors give it all the authenticity it needs, clearly delighted by the ebullience of their characters. "
"A big, mean, pulpy movie that drags the old Hollywood historical epic out of the shadows and into the cultural moment."
"Stories of heroism, loyalty, implacable enemies and epic battles-to-win-the-day are as old as Hollywood. The Woman King makes the genre fresh again. Go and see it on the biggest screen you can find."
"A film you’re supposed to admire, never mind its obvious shortcomings...For all its claims of being an epic film, it's blighted by some pretty ordinary cinematography...The messy battle scenes look as though they were edited in a blender."
"An exciting character-driven spectacle of historical conflict, political machinations and heroism."
"Everything -- performances, costumes, score, swashbuckling choreography, courtly intrigue -- comes together, as Dana Stevens’ screenplay hits all the right notes."
Emotional and gripping
"With great visuals and choreography making each battle a physically brutal dance, we get a sense of what these women are fighting for whether ""each other"" means the Agojie or Africa itself."
"The cinematography is what makes the film a success. The direction, the acting, the action and the execution are all flawless, just like the women themselves."
" It is a film designed to inspire audiences and elicit cheers and, by and large, it succeeds."
"Technically, The Woman King is an accomplished historical epic that doesn’t stray too far from the formula. However, the real life grounding and the strength of the performances make it one of 2022’s most rewarding surprises."
"The Woman King accomplishes a magnificent feat: delivering an epic, action-packed tale without sacrificing character development.  [Full review in Spanish]"
"Exhilarating, suspenseful and moving, The Woman King is an epic action film that celebrates the power of women."
"The Woman King engagingly blends fiction and historical fact into a thematically rich deeply nuanced story of coming-of-age, finding your center, then choosing how you’ll stand your ground."
"In the case of The Woman King, we have anti-history mobilized in the selfish interests of an upper-middle class milieu, rewriting the past for money and status."
The Woman King provides a template for how men can advocate for women.
"In short, filmmaker Gina Prince-Bythewood and a stellar cast bring the legendary Agoji warrior women to life."
"2022 is proving to be the year of female-driven narratives...but The Woman King brings it to another level that celebrates Black women through its power, pride and poise to create one of the best films this year."
"Every historical epic needs a central, larger-than-life character and star to match. As General Nanisca... Viola Davis delivers a groundbreaking performance proving that she has yet to reveal the full gamut of her acting capabilities."
"Thankfully, all flimsiness in the screenplay is overcome by the director, Gina Prince-Bythewood, and her committed cast, who transform a familiar dramatic milieu (Mulan meets Gladiator meets Wonder Woman) into thrilling, amphetamine-rush cinema. "
"Yes, the Woman King could be filed under wish-fulfilment, but that’s true of so many action classics."
A great time at the movies. A rare cinematic event.
"With its slickly orchestrated violence, epic battle scenes and achingly cool heroes, this rousing crowd-pleaser is also this year’s most thrilling action movie."
"The appeal of this film, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, derives entirely from its reversal of gender assumptions."
"The end result is a novel, representation-stretching enterprise that, paradoxically, plays like the “sort of film they don’t make any more”."
"exemplary intersectional feminist call to arms for the African sisterhood to keep building on the achievements of their female ancestors & to keep fighting – & dancing – as they did, or might have done... with or without the approval of their patriarch
"
"A breathless, thought-provoking and often brilliant movie that is determined to embolden end educate those watching it."
"While the story sees the state draw back from involvement in the slave trade, questions of complicity still linger more than most popcorn movies would allow."
A first-rate epic combining commanding performances and storming action with a powerful story.
"The Woman King isn’t intended to be any ordinary account of history. It is a vibrant, restorative celebration of Black womanhood in all its glory."
"The film uses history as a jumping off point for myth-making and in the process delivers an all-out action spectacle, just from a perspective movies have tended to ignore."
This is a grand spectacle with vivid and theatrical performances.
"Fierce, full of action and drama, ""The Woman King"" is yet another platform to showcase the amazing talent of Viola Davis. "
"The Woman King is cinema at its finest. It speaks to a generation who understands the importance of representation and couples that enthusiasm as an unapologetic celebration of Black womanhood.
"
A thunderously cinematic good time: see it on the biggest screen you can find.
"To get complex, scheming, heroic and strong black characters -- exhibiting much of what it means to be black on screen -- within the context of a historical movie is a treat."
"The fight choreography is stunning, with Prince-Bythewood showcasing the abilities of her performers in shots that grab hold of your eyeballs and refuse to let go."
"Unlike the all-too-common, typically lazy ""girl power"" tropes found in your average blockbuster, director Gina Prince-Bythewood not only respects her female characters, but also cares for them as complex and flawed people."
"Viola Davis introduced this film by calling it her magnum opus--and she was not kidding.  As the aging but brave warrior at the center of the film, she makes what should have been a mundane war movie something much more memorable"
"Predictable script hitting every conventional beat... It all plays out like a Disney movie made for kids, except with copious throat slitting – and even that is relatively tame in order to maintain the PG-13 rating"
"The battles are exciting yet human-scaled, unlike those in today's blockbusters; injuries feel real."
"All in all, The Woman King is an exciting, action-packed, history-based melodrama with a new and unusual setting, gorgeous look and sound, and dynamic performances -- but with occasional jarring flaws in the script."
"But The Woman King is at its most powerful when it focuses on the army of women who don’t have superpowers but rely on training, strategy and unity."
"Echoes of Gladiator and Braveheart resonate here almost deliberately, The Woman King surrenders to narrative conventions and clichés, seeking the safest paths... [Full review in Spanish]"
"Phenomenal performances elevate a script that leaves much to be desired, falling back on its impressive action sequences to satisfy and entertain."
"An action film of the times that doesn't quite serve the slightly touched upon themes -- machismo, slavery -- with a far-fetched romantic story..."
"It’s fast, and it’s loose, and it totally works."
"Prince-Bythewood celebrates these women warriors through impressive fight scenes that are athletic but realistic, eschewing the sort of CGI overkill that has run rampant in recent action films. "
"The Woman King is a crowd pleaser at its core, intent on entertaining the audience as much as elevating a story that many in its audience may not know (though they’ll probably still need to do a bit of research). "
A welcome rarity in an audiovisual industry that's clearly seeking to update their outlook and stories. [Full review in Spanish]
The Woman King is a rousing battle epic that wears its heart on its sleeve.
The Woman King has two unnecessary plot points that distract from the power of the story of the Agojie. 
"If you're someone who loves action movies that use ""true events"" as an entry to a deeper narrative about surviving trauma, defying misogyny and overcoming personal torment in the face, along with all the ass-kicking, then The Woman King is a masterpiece."
The biggest complaint I have about “Prey” is that it didn’t have a theatrical release.
"Easily the best film in the Predator franchise since the original, this prequel is brilliantly directed by 10 Cloverfield Lane filmmaker Dan Trachtenberg, with a home run of a star turn by Native American actor Amber Midthunder."
"It commits to centre Naru’s journey and the obstacles she faced throughout the movie, and their final encounter, which results in a satisfying conclusion."
"Prey offers an excellent example of less being more, especially in a series long known for its over-the-top dialogue and gory violence."
"Prey lives up to high expectations, being the first movie in the Predator saga to come close to or even surpass the original. Amber Midthunder delivers one of the best performances of her career."
The perfect predator movie 
"What makes Prey so compulsively watchable is that it does exactly what it promises to do. It’s a frantic fight for survival led by a compelling cast of characters. When the audience finally gets a good look at the Predator, it’s a glorious reveal."
"Prey is tied for first place with Predator as the best Predator movie and is definitely one of the best movies of the year. It is one of the best movies to grace the action, horror, and science-fiction genres."
I loved Prey. I think it’s the best summer “blockbuster” of the year.
"The new installment in the Predator franchise risked a lot by changing its name to Prey, but the stellar film wound up earning it wholeheartedly."
"The Predator franchise has new life thanks to Prey. The film works on a multitude of levels as a perfect prequel, monster movie, sci-fi flick, a badass heroine story, and win for Native representation and portrayals. "
"With a stunning debut in the Hulu original film Prey, Amber Midthunder proved herself as a sci-fi/action star to watch."
"Prey makes for a pragmatic prequel to Predator, but not a pulsating entry to reinvigorate the franchise. "
Questions that Predator raised all those years ago — Who is the invader? Whose land is being invaded? — rebound with special resonance in Prey.
Prey critiques the assumption that survival requires dominance.
"Prey reinvigorates and revitalizes the predator legacy, going back in time to show how the franchise still has a future."
This was a very solid new addition to a franchise that is been mediocre at best. Great leading performance by Ms. Midthunder.
It's a tight hour and a half that doesn't lag. Very solid performance and phenomenal action scenes. Love the focus on an authentic cast!
"It's gritty and muddy yet still beautiful and invigorating, it's packed with seriously tense action, and it's all about using cunning tactics and the environment around you to outwit and outsmart a vicious Predator warrior..."
"Dan Trachtenberg didn’t need to prove anything after directing certified masterpiece 10 Cloverfield Lane as his first feature, but this is a quite good, generously gory Predator flick."
"A prequel to the Predator franchise, this taut and thrilling is atmospheric and exceptionally well-told."
"Amber Midthunder is the best thing to happen to this franchise since Topher Grace bought it in <i>Predators</i>, and while it's probably too much to hope for a follow-up, she and Trachtenberg have given us the best Predator since the original."
"I’m not sure I can recommend Prey enough. It’s visually beautiful, full of layered stories and environments and it has a completely badass female lead that is even tougher than maybe even Dutch, himself."
“Prey” is one sci-fi opus worth tracking down.
"Prey is a worthy sequel to McTiernan’s iconic original. Its innovative approach takes the concept in new directions and invigorates an aging franchise. Despite the many odds stacked against it, Prey is one of the most exciting films of the year.

"
"What Trachtenberg gets wonderfully right here is not simply paying homage to the original and crafting a decent hunt/showdown, but laying ground for its own originality throughout the film. "
"A refreshing, lean and mean take on the Predator mythology."
A great movie? Absolutely not. But it won’t insult your intelligence nearly as much as so many movies being churned out for streaming platforms.
"Prey just works. Cinematic scale, strong performances, beautiful attention to detail, top-notch action sequences... it’s a solid outing that deserves the largest screen possible."
"An exciting Predator prequel that features a hugely compelling lead (and her dog!). One wishes there was a deeper exploration of Comanche culture, but the inclusion of both Indigenous characters and women is incredibly welcome"
"If you if you're into the Predator franchise,  you'll enjoy it. If you didn't like it since the first one, I think you should give this one a shot, and I think you'll enjoy it. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
"Hallelujah, praise the Lord! At long last, somebody did something creative with the Predator series! It took only 35 years after the release of the original science-fiction thriller, which well deserved a sequel but not the three that it got."
"Prey is a slower, more thoughtful but no less captivating film. "
Trachtenberg brings the 'Predator' franchise back to basics in a fun and empowering outing that boasts an outstanding lead performance from Amber Midthunder.
"Let's hope Prey starts a new wave of really great, back-to-basics Predator movies."
"... Nasty, brutish and short — like the best B-movies — but far from dumb. "
"Prey establishes its conflict with no fuss, gives us a hero straining against the role 18th-century Comanche culture dictates for her, and doesn’t skimp on the action."
"With Prey, director Dan Trachtenberg very effectively regenerates a brand that had overstayed its welcome."
A sequel that actually lives up to the original.
"The film is a ripper, both figuratively and literally."
"It’s probable that no one expected Prey to be a monster hit, but the film stumbled upon a good meet and matchup, a cross-genre pollination that suddenly opened up entirely new narrative directions."
"“Prey” takes no prisoners. One of this summer’s most exhilarating action movies, it both reinvents the “Predator” franchise and layers it with thematic depth, thanks to a taut, character-driven script and well-choreographed action sequences."
"Although [Trachtenberg] doesn’t properly innovate in Prey, he also doesn’t complicate, embracing narrative straightforwardness and modernizing through spectacular imagery and effects. "
"The fact that this movie is centered around cultures foreign to most Americans, as well as being set in a time and environment alien to most of us, helps to set this movie apart from most other films in this genre."
"This is a multifaceted experience ripe with the kind of blood-pumping adrenaline common in action movies of the VHS era, but elegiac compositions put it in league with today’s progressive arthouse trends. "
"A compact yet supremely satisfying action experience that caused me to go back and rewatch the original Predator, just to see if Prey had actually stolen its franchise crown."
The result is a thoroughly satisfying underdog story that taps into the pleasures of old-school action cinema.
"Over 300 years ago in Comanche territory, largely by the light of fires and of the moon, when warriors are faced [an]  otherworldly, technologically advanced monster... Trachtenberg shows mastery of frame, pace and suspense, and the casting is superb,"
Prey manages to tap into the classic setup of the original Predator without ever feeling like it's retreading familiar ground. The action is close-quarters and visceral while the setting and time period are a welcome change. Best since the original!
Prey succeeds on every level.
 Director Dan Trachtenberg has made a juggernaut of a film without an ounce of fat. 
Should have been released in theaters. Pure entertainment from beginning to end. THIS is the Predator movie we've wanted since the original. Love that it was so rooted in the hunt and what a predator's natural instinct is. Amber Midthunder is stellar.
It's a fascinating film.
"It’s easily the best Predator movie since the original. By stripping the Predator’s story to the bone and adding the friction between Indigenous peoples and European colonizers, Dan Trachtenberg creates a taut story of hunter vs. hunter vs. hunter. "
"While “Prey” has an undeniably cool nostalgic kick, it also manages to put its own original spin on the franchise in large part thanks to its period, its setting, and one lights-out lead performance from Amber Midthunder."
"Prey did something that I believed was impossible for this franchise. It gave a lot of heart, a passionate and powerful main character, beautiful cinematography, and most importantly, an amazingly strong and fresh take on the Predator story!"
For my money it’s the best since the original.
"The fight choreography is expertly staged and shot. No blurry camera pans and choppy editing that leaves you wondering what just happened. It’s top-notch, theater-quality action piped into your living room."
Prey evolves the female action hero by incorporating quieter strengths into her characterization.
"Predator at its best, in an exceptional survival tale reflecting a people’s myths & legends seemingly confirmed by the arrival of the inexplicable. ... [A] deeper, definitive experience."
Prey is the best Predator movie after the original.  [Full review in Spanish]
"Sometimes less is more and simple is safer, but when the execution is as good as it is with Prey, I’ll take that more often than not."
"Never before has 'final girl' been foreshadowed quite so hard - but, all in all, despite a gathering pile of minor misgivings, the film works pretty well as a fairly straightforward, but reasonably paced film with lots of well-handled action sequences."
"For the first time since the Reagan administration, the Predator series delivers. "
Hollywood loves to crank out boring action movies. But Hulu’s Prey is anything but. It plays off of and reverses long-standing Hollywood tropes about Native Americans to craft an alien thriller that actually delivers.
"A thrilling and suspenseful horror action-adventure. The filmmakers incorporate the Indigenous cultural aspect in a clever way that works for the story, featuring a phenomenal female protagonist who's a force to be reckoned with."
"The rare franchise installment that finds a fresh, compelling spin on the material while also effectively drawing inspiration from the original without being suffocated by it."
Prey basks in a visual style that’s attractive but rarely expressive: a capable sort of commercial work.
"The performances are unforced and natural; both Midthunder and Beavers exude screen charisma without making a big deal of it. Technically the film is quite beautiful, evoking the sort of pristine wilderness captured so hauntingly in The Revenant."
It’s the kind of franchise-furthering sequel that actively plays on your memories of the prior films without just defaulting to the hit parade.
[Prey is] my favorite Predator movie.
"An impressive calling card for rising director Dan Trachtenberg... with a haunting, respectful recreation of Native American life in the sparsely settled interior of the raw continent. "
Prey is the exhilarating back-to-basics action thriller that the franchise sorely needs. 
"Each step of the movie is telegraphed, masticated, and the predictable veiled as false classicism evoking films like The Naked Prey (1965), and it never quite defies the [franchise] mythology. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Unlike so many other franchises, I now hope this one doesn’t go extinct anytime soon."
"Thanks to the Indigenous context in 'Prey', the story develops overall themes of predator and prey dynamics from a new perspective, all the way through entire food chains."
"The effort is appreciated, but for me there is only one 'Predator' movie. It premiered in 1987 and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger. This prequel is below, it does not even reach the heels. [Full review in Spanish]"
This film’s creative team had its heart in the right place and honours the people it portrays including the people whose location they borrowed.
"Director Dan Trachtenberg makes the most of the wilderness setting and sharp young cast, and holding back on effects while skilfully cranking up suspense."
Prey turns the franchise on its head and delivers a surprisingly emotional and epic story.
"Hulu’s clever prequel to Predator is so much more than IP exploitation—it’s bloodthirsty, self-assured, and crowd-pleasing"
The perseverance of the human spirit is a universal story one could inject anywhere. Trachtenberg fully uses the 90+ minutes allotted to him to return the Predator franchise to stable ground.
This is a surprisingly good entry in the Predator franchise.
"A marvelous and fun post-modern fable that uses the depraved invader as a metaphor for US history, while also reflecting on indigenous cultures and its women...  "
Trachtenberg overuses computer-generated special effects to such a degree that virtually all of the action set-pieces are hopelessly drained of energy and excitement...
An absolute winner
It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a film as purely thrilling and completely satisfying as Prey.
Trachtenberg took an unprecedented risk and succeeded
"The result is pretty fun, if also a tonal mishmash of goofiness and gorgeous landscapes."
"Stands on its own as an efficient, expectedly gory thriller."
"This is a fresh and exciting standalone film that entertains, educates, and fires the imagination and admiration for Midthunder’s dedication."
"A perfect example of how new perspectives naturally enrich stories that have been retold, providing a shield against clichés to amplify results. [Full review in Spanish]"
Prey is a fantastic genre piece that is sure to satisfy fans of the Predator franchise as well as those who just want a grand survival story. Amber Midthunder is amazing as Naru.
A pointed counter to the muscular mayhem of 1987’s Predator...
A “Predator” story should have well-crafted and excitingly staged scenes of humans fighting an alien. This picture has plenty.
A film with lots of feminist Western and just a tad of sci-fi. 
"Loyal to the max to the original, this film successfully reboots the exhausted franchise precisely for going back to its basics yet using a protagonist diametrically different from the muscular soldier of yonder. [Full review in Spanish]"
"I liked how everything just kind of came back full circle… I thought that was really, really, well done."
"This was not about shock value at all, I thought it was tastefully done.
"
Surprisingly good.  [Full review in Spanish]
"Filled with stunning cinematography, the film is an intense, immersive, sometimes surreal, descent into an otherworldly milieu of folkloric horror and medieval barbarism. "
"As a bloody and most certainly trippy revenge tale, The Northman is astounding in many places. Eggers may not have created the ultimate Viking tale, but he has crafted an astonishing spectacle that combines his established style with something larger."
"Eggers’ visual style is a roller coaster of primordial, oneiric imagery of an epic, wild landscape, turbulent supernatural forces and untamed nature sans any whiff of domestication."
"Robert Eggers has crafted one for the ages… The Northman  is a cinematic epic that blew my mind from start to finish. Lavishing cinematography that brings to life this era, visceral violence that adds to the world, & a jaw dropping third act"
"The Northman is an incredibly gifted film full of hostility, genealogy, strength, and desire. "
"Violent and powerful from start to finish, The Northman tells an epic, period accurate Viking tale that easily immerses its audience throughout the entire run-time."
"The Northman is a story that’s been told many times over, and save for showcasing the stunning scenery of Ireland, this adaptation is nothing to write home about."
"The Northman isn’t trying to elevate horror nor dismantle fetishistic fantasies. It’s a fully-formed exercise in realigning blockbuster pictures back to the way they should be: big, visually breathtaking, and bolstered by a unique vision."
"By the time the end credits hit, you will be waiting for it to begin anew, and that is one of the highest compliments you could give a movie of this size and breadth. "
"It provides all the weirdness, gore, beauty and singularity that you would expect from this director’s take on a Viking tale of vengeance."
"The Northman’s carefully choreographed, single-shot takes and startlingly lit close-ups blow the spatially disorienting and over-edited style of so many contemporary action films completely out of the fjord."
"The Northman is practically bursting with testosterone. The story of Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), a Viking Prince hellbent on revenge, Robert Eggers‘s third film is essentially a case study in the destructive nature of unyielding masculinity."
"Northman is one of Robert Egger best films. The scope, the scale, the atmospheric building of Norse mythology is groundbreaking. Along with some insanely well acted performances and beyond thrilling action and revenge based story. Must Watch Masterpiece!"
The Northman creates a unique saga that taps into something truly primal before one hell of an ending.
"An intoxicating and epic blend of violence, mysticism, and breathtaking visuals."
"Spectacle, pageantry and myth combine with blood, mud and abs for a dazzling, uproarious Viking spree in which Alexander Skarsgård seeks to avenge the murder of his father with the aid of Anya Taylor-Joy and Icelandic national treasure Björk. "
"The Northman stands as a stark reminder that there is still a place in cinema for gorgeous, inspired odysseys, rife with literary allusions, deep-seated spiritual meanings, and an exploration of complex human emotions. "
"This brutally violent, yet soaringly lyrical action epic is quite unlike anything captured on screen before. "
"The Northman is an epic the likes of which we hardly see in Hollywood anymore, carefully curated by a master of the medium and packed with powerhouse performances."
Eggers is still a major reason to stay interested in whatever movies are becoming.
"Not since Christopher Nolan’s Inception has a studio executive shown such balls of steel, or perhaps I should say boller av stal."
"Eggers embraces the filth, the mud, the moss, the viscera that were part and parcel of the day."
[Eggers has] gone for broke with this epic arthouse blockbuster that mixes Hamlet and Gladiator through the lens of a hardcore metal album cover.
It is disappointing that The Northman goes past what would have been a truly radical ending and extends itself for a zany climax that qualifies as Valhalla porn.
"The Northman is a brutal and violent film, felt in both its protagonist’s appetite for revenge and a world that seems to require suffering to continue turning."
"The Northman isn’t exactly a triumph, but with its many knockout moments, it represents a big step forward for the youngish director Robert Eggers, who for the first time has a big budget ($90 million) to work with. "
"Hopefully it will be received by audiences for what I believe it is: a memorable, harrowing, cautionary nightmare."
"""The Northman"" is winningly engaging at every turn and is best when it becomes an unabashed technical marvel. If it lacks the unpredictable looseness of “The Lighthouse” (Eggers’ best film) it offers clarity of vision with propulsive energy throughout."
A breathtaking cinematic onslaught that savvily turns hellishness into movie heaven.
"A new oddity in which horror, revenge and Norse mythology go hand in hand in one of the most suggestive and visceral shows that we've been able to enjoy on the big screen in the last years."
A ferocious revenge tale that's heavy on the blood and sweat but light on the tears.
The most violent film I’ve ever seen to also feature a stellar fart joke.
Gratuitously extenuating retina trips... A nightmare in its own right that portrays the tragedy and the end of a treacherous and ultra-masculinized world. [Full review in Spanish] 
"Beastly warriors, assassinated kings, and soothsaying seers look down upon a brutal landscape where the common person could be free one moment and conquered the next with little to say in how their fate will play out... it's best to be prepared for both."
"While The Northman isn't, in the end, as wholly perfect as Eggers debut The VVitch, he's still three-for-three and more ambitious each time he gets behind the camera. "
"You can tell Eggers wanted a more elevated, visually-driven movie and I hope a director’s cut shows up someday. "
"Made me watch The Princess Bride. It's not a coincidence. Like The Northman, it's about vengeance, duels, fights, colorful characters, a love story that destiny couldn't break... I go to bed thinking about it. Not The Northman. [Full review in Spanish]"
Bobby Eggs might finally be starting to make movies that I can enjoy.
Director and co-writer Robert Eggers is fascinated by the sounds and textures of the pagan and the primal.
The Northman is an exceptionally crafted film with unconventional visuals and a filmmaking voice behind it that is powerfully unique. 
"Blood runs, mud flies and bones crack — in crisp, percussive ways you’ve hopefully never heard in real life — throughout The Northman, a grand, gut-spilling Norse epic that feels at once earthily ancient and thrillingly modern. "
"An authentic-looking and dream-filled world of a thousand years ago, sometimes beautiful and often brutal — but always fascinating."
"A savage and mesmerizing Viking saga like no other, Robert Eggers’ The Northman leaves your senses bludgeoned by the time the credits roll."
"A complete cinematic experience from the sound, score, acting, aesthetic, story, and directing is masterfully put together and executed.  "
"If you’re looking for a bold and nihilistic tale, you’ve come to – quite literally – the perfect place."
"It's brutal and violent, but there's something really beautiful about it. "
"A magnificent Mise-en-scène, straddling the subtle and the brutally direct, in a narrative that fearlessly advances towards existential fatalism. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Nicole Kidman steals her scenes in this immaculately crafted tale of revenge. The action brings the heat, but the story may leave you cold. "
"While the violence, blood, and mud won’t be for everyone, The Northman is a rewarding film for those who venture into its wilderness."
"A historical epic without the epic, a revenge plot with all the agency of revenge removed. What is left?  A two and a half hour plodding viking re-enactment."
"An all-too-rare modern example of an auteur-driven epic, The Northman demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible."
"This is not the sanitized, horned-helmet-wearing, Marvel comics Thor vision of Viking-hood. This is blood and mud and ice and pagan gods, and, reader, I am here for it."
"For all the nonsense The Northman trails in its wake, this is also a big, brawling and absolutely beautifully shot and scored film."
"There is no better word than “visceral”, in its broadest meaning, as a compact synthesis of everything that happens here. [Full review in Spanish]"
Eggers builds it as a visceral sword-and-sandal epic that never loses its rhythm of action or sense of spectacularity in portraying barbaric times. [Full review in Spanish]
"In The Northman, Robert Eggers sheds the title of a horror director. He shows just how far his range can lead him, and it is exciting to see him lean into that."
"It’s not a bad movie in the least, it just feels like a lot of the Eggers special sauce got watered down, even if the brutality went way, way up."
"A Shakespearean nightmare centering on the obsession in which rage reigns supreme, but also its poetry... [Full review in Spanish]"
"Eggers continues his seemingly meteoric ascent to world-class filmmaker status, expanding his toolkit to encompass a breathtakingly intense, attention-grabbing, single-take approach to scene and story creation unlike anything else."
It’s a man’s man’s man’s man’s man’s world. 
"A ferocious, epic tale that is beautifully brutal.  "
"With its naked sword fight on top of an exploding volcano, The Northman is rad...its blood-soaked tale of vengeance right in line with the great Icelandic sagas, an epic cinematic rendering of a story that has been told for at least a thousand years"
"Visually it is darkly stunning, but storywise it is all over the place. Nicole Kidman is one film and Alexander Sharsgard is in another. Anna Taylor-Joy doesn't know where the heck she's supposed to be.
"
Eggers' film didn't resonate with me after I left the theater. I never felt pulled into the orbit of Amleth's revenge close enough to really empathize with his plight. Gorgeously shot yet oddly hollow emotionally. 
"I wanted to love Robert Eggers’s follow-up to The Witch and The Lighthouse, but maybe a big-budget Viking saga just isn’t the right fit for a wonderful weirdo like him?"
"An immersive event from its first seconds.
[Full review in Spanish]"
"This is a movie that doesn't shy away from emotions, it embraces them fully. The actors don't shy away from overacting, either, they revel in it, and this is both refreshing and entertaining."
You genuinely feel how much his characters have faith in their gods and their folk tales as an extension of their everyday lives.
"The Northman is brutal, bloody and violent, even a little gory at times. But its beautiful aesthetics displayed in every shot and every sequence place it above other movies with similar topics. [REVIEW IN SPANISH]"
Hyper-stylized… form triumphs over substance. 
" If we are fools in doubt, we can break the cycle of violence and revenge...or else leave behind a scorched Earth…where only losers can reside.

"
"Epic, massive, and ostentatious. [Full review in Spanish]"
Eggers' latest is wicked and delightfully weird without ever losing its grip on being a compelling character study engulfed in dazzling imagery. It’s his best film to date and the most confounding studio film of the year.
...an epically-misguided trainwreck that couldn’t possibly be less interesting or involving.
"What Eggers has done with this film is to develop an intense story of revenge, without hiding how barbaric and bloody and brutal life was at that time for these people. Full review in Spanish."
"The Northman falls short of being an epic film, but the mastery in composition of the film is noteworthy."
"Execution, performance, and art direction are all unparalleled, but the whole simply proves a solid familial melodrama in the end. They can’t all be ""great."""
"Eggers has embraced the wildness. creating a world of primal ritual where the spirit realm regularly interacts with the material one, and life is nasty, brutish, and short. Mercifully so."
"Predictable at every turn, but the operatic style of the effects leave you entranced - even chilled - for the entire film"
"This is a film that gives what is wanted, without any regrets, through an environment that’s as angry as it is awesome."
"Drenched in testosterone, Northman is less concerned with reinventing the wheel with it's narrative built on the same mythology that inspired Hamlet, but rather with making you feel the visceral human anger and rage underpinning it's entire proceedings. "
"A death-metal ode to honor, retribution and sacrifice that casts payback in a surprisingly, and thrillingly, positive light."
"It’s a good movie, yet also a little disappointing, because it’s not quite good enough to get away with being so little fun."
he tale of Amleth (played wonderfully here by Alexander Skarsgård) could be called Shakespearian.
"If meant to be a provocative meditation on freewill and revenge, and a bloody, visceral, painstakingly-detailed spectacle  it maybe only delivers on the spectacle."
"A violent, visceral, and engrossing voyage."
"Exciting and sprawling, The Northman is almost a throwback to an earlier time of movie-making, with a story of redemption, presented in a fascinating and spellbinding way."
"A brutal, testosterone-fueled profusion of ""Game of Thrones"", 300, and Kill Bill"
"Both beautiful and brutal, The Northman is a saga worth seeing."
"Skarsgård never once puffs his chest to assert his place as the hero, in complete alignment with Amleths sense of prophecy bestowed upon him at an early age."
"The storyline was simple yet effective. The landscape, the production values -- I was all in."
"Overall, despite the lavish treatment, the film is surprisingly dreary..."
"It's the creative juices of Robert Eggers that gives The Northman its unique identity, from the impeccable detail and design to the wild flourishes and overindulgences."
"As we get to summer with a lot of polished blockbusters, this is something a bit grittier, and a bit more interesting. "
It's Hamlet with a lot more blood and a lot less clothes.
"Striking and compelling, for a film that toys with the concept of defying one's fate, the narrative does feel disappointingly stuck to a predetermined path, missing the surprises of Eggers' past films."
What you’ll get is neither the bold weirdness of Eggers’s previous efforts in the critically-acclaimed margins nor a clean strike into the blockbuster mainstream.
"The Northman is signature Eggers, with an almost maniacal dedication to period authenticity, big themes and some surrealist and supernatural touches."
"""The Northman"" is a sweeping epic driven by blood and brutality, offering up a bleak and unrelenting take on the legend that inspired it. It might be great - hell, it almost certainly IS great - but sadly, it left me behind."
"This is teenager cinema par excellence, an opera of old-world mayhem fit for Beavis and Butthead."
Never have I walked out so pleased with a movie that also had me absolutely disgusted. A true horror gem.
A throwback to old school Video Nasties & B Rated horror movies. Ortega and Goth steal the show…. I left intrigued with what the prequel/sequel will be but A24 has another hit for indie films & I can’t stop thinking about the film
X felt like it was meandering without a purpose. And maybe that was the point–to enjoy the ride without being bogged down by a hefty plot. Those going to the theatre to see the nudity and gore of the horror movies of yesteryear will leave satisfied.
"Separately, X and Pearl might not have made my 10 Best of 2022 list; together, how could they not?"
A gruesome slasher reminiscent of classic horror.
"Ends with a wholly satisfying finale and avoids the pitfalls of frustrating the audience, as so many independent horror films seem to do. It’s a slower burn for sure, but what a bloody, gory, rewarding ride."
"I can give X the benefit of the doubt [with hindsight], accepting it as an entrypoint into a much larger world regardless of how incomplete it ultimately feels on its own."
"X was true to its name, explicit sexual scenes, horrify scenarios & every more on the stories backdrop. But as a horror film Ti West nails it with his touch on horror story telling and worst case scenario perspective for every character it’s a insane ride"
"It's crass and ghastly, with an on-the-nose premise fit for the often- sensationalist slasher genre and the salacious X-rated cinema embedded in this story."
The film itself goes beyond being merely a ‘blood and guts killer time’ with an array of porn star characters. It feeds into your adrenaline and spikes it up to ten.
If you're looking for a slow burn horror flick with plenty of atmosphere and faux-grindhouse aesthetics then X gon' give it to you!
"The characters are fleshed-out and kooky — you’ll mourn when they meet their inevitable slaughter. And for a slasher, the acting is remarkably good: Jenna Ortega and Mia Goth in particular are scene-stealers."
"X reanimates perennial fears of aging, older women, and one’s fading relevance."
"X is a daring slasher, filled with unexpected twists that leave viewers stewing in uncomfortable moments and horrifying realizations. "
X is a bold horror film that might just be the best dirty movie you’ve seen all year.
"If you go into this with your eyes open, it delivers a well-crafted slasher horror on all counts, even if its finale and body-count are hardly a surprise."
"Ti West skillfully blends style with substance in A24’s X, delivering a riff on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre with a few subversive – and sexy – twists."
"Whatever West is trying here doesn’t ultimately land, maybe because West himself doesn’t seem to care about any of these people."
"Raw, emotional, upsetting, and unafraid to take its audiences to grotesque places, X is one of the very best films of the year."
"X manages to tap into the nostalgic style of 70's horror while being a breath of fresh air for the genre. Ti West shows through his masterful directing, while winking at the audience, that you can put a ton of artistic flair into a ""dirty movie."" "
Ti West’s “X” is an unashamed ode to slasher movies that manages to capture what makes the good ones good while still being hampered by what makes the bad ones bad.
"It pays homage to the adult film industry of the 70s, but I'm afraid it loses its guts by going through the easy and boring paths of conventional exploitation slasher. [Full review in Spanish]"
Now this is the modern-day answer to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre we’ve been waiting for!
"There's lashings of sex and gore, plus a few surprises along the way."
"Smart, savvy and spectacularly staged while straddling and embracing that fine line between pleasure and pain."
"Pure fun, X intelligently exploits the genre's codes without transgressing and incorporating small doses of humor for the seasoned viewer. [Full review in Spanish]"
"An exquisite filmic anachronism that, disguised as the usual slasher, develops a discourse that gets under the skin and that, ultimately, elevates it as one of the greatest and riskiest titles of 2022."
"The impressive direction and delightful performances, anchored by a terrific central turn from Goth, make this an enthralling horror entry that can satisfy the hunger for exciting spectacle and more sophisticated storytelling."
"West's best film to date: a gooey, ebullient orgy of the lewd and the learned, the squalid and the sumptuous."
"There’s nothing original about West’s highly stylized film, it’s just a down and dirty horror jam with a decent batch of jump-scares. "
"... A film tribute to 70's B-movies, particularly Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Deep Throat. "
There's more sincerity in a good porn film... [Full review in Spanish]
"X, first hour of the film is an homage to 70s psycho-sexual-film making and the last 45 minutes is a psycho-biddy/slasher. It's interesting to say the least but at no point was this a scary film."
"A real delight, a genius within the genre that while paying homage to the classics, applies a rolling pin to expand the plot towards the unexpected. [Full review in Spanish]"
"While certainly creepy and provocative at times, X stumbles from the pretentious pedestal this “elevated” horror film has propped itself upon."
It's Mia Goth's show. The English-Brazilian actress is building a fine repertoire in the horror genre as someone who likes to dive into the deep end of psychotic-tinged stories with a human element coercing through it.
"Overall, X is an entertaining and vivid throwback horror, with a mesmerizing performance from Goth, even if it doesn't slash quite as deep as it intends. "
"A lubricated and bloody nightmare where desire, pain, coitus, and murder are inseparable parts of the same basic act, animal and profoundly human. [Full review in Spanish]"
... a slightly unfocused twist on the sex-and-death genre.
Equally entertains and frightens… a genuine cinephile's feast. [Full review in Spanish]
"A quality horror film. 
[Full review in Spanish]"
"Aside from its throwback grindhouse visual aesthetic, the film provides only hit-or-miss laughs and thrills, relying on stock characters and gratuitous gore rather than refreshing the formula."
"West's return to horror is beautifully shot and features several stand-out female performances. The relationship between porn and horror isn't as novel as critics made it out to be, but the innovative ""stutter cuts"" alone make X worth checking out"
Think of this as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets Deep Throat. Ti West makes it perfectly clear that hes paying homage to these iconic films as he fills the movie with the meta commentary and tropes of this era in filmmaking.
"Endorsing the patterns of several classics but endowing them with unbridled new audacity, this shocker also provides substantial gore."
"Sometimes in life, you just want a simple slasher movie that checks the boxes and then some, X is that movie. Mixing great tension, kills, brutality, and solid characters, X delivers one of the better horror movies of recent years."
"Ty West directs a horror that moves beyond simple slaughter. He expands into a broader discussion of religion, sexuality, and gender, thereby making X a slasher joyride with something more to say. "
"Making an artful horror movie is like making an avant-garde porno film: Whatever creative touches you want to include in it, ultimately the filmmaker has to show the people what they came to see. "
"There's tension, proper fleshiness that makes the audience wince, and the actors seem to be really enjoying themselves. Entertaining and repugnant, in a good way."
Still gives me shivers
It was entertaining. It stuck with me. i didn't know what to expect... I feel like this was a new angle for a slasher flick.
"X is a gory, funny, surprisingly restrained and yet still gleefully amoral film."
Ti West blends old school homage with modern horror thrills to craft a blackly comic and surprisingly poignant tale loaded with scares and gut-churning gore. 
"Its got a decent script, an energetic cast, and lots of style."
"It's a love letter to the best of horror, and further, freedom of expression. There are moments of surprising, haunting beauty that add nothing to the plot, but everything to the experience. With X, West can be compared to Craven or even Carpenter."
"A near-perfect film, cut off at the knees to make room for future sequels, but sequels that will surely flesh out the story. "
"A film that unabashedly combines fairly explicit sex scenes with an ultra gory slasher, and explores the relationship between sex and death. 


"
Ti West’s X aims its slasher-movie homage straight at classic horror fanatics.
A meticulously-crafted ode to vintage horror.
"This is really great, a throwback to those grindhouse films of the 1970s. "
"Falls off a bit once the killing starts, but Ti West has crafted an entertaining, humorous and sex-positive homage to '70s horror films that is just downright fun."
"If you can get on its same wavelength — which admittedly takes the first ten or fifteen minutes — and understand what West is doing, then you’ll have a good time."
"Whether you buy the premise or not, this is still one of the best horror films thats been made in a long time. The photography, editing and overall vibe harken to nostalgia movies like Boogie Nights and Dazed and Confused. "
Ti West is becoming one of the only directors since John Landis that’s capable of crafting a true horror comedy.
"Proudly brings us right into the heart of horror cinema at its most sordid... without sacrificing any of the intellectual density that ""elevated horror"" is so proud of."
A nasty-minded slasher with a wicked sense of humour and a taste for blood
...an exceedingly (and sometimes excessively) deliberate horror film that benefits from its atmospheric sensibilities and roster of top-notch performances...
This is a compendium of horror films from the 70s and early 80s all rolled into one.
"Whether you want to breathe along with it remains an open question. Know this, though, X may not transcend its horror  niche but it embraces it with unwavering commitment."
"Xs gory violence matched with sexual imagery makes for a uniquely entertaining slasher, albeit one that you may not be in a rush to watch again due to how uncomfortable it is."
It’s an out-and-out slasher that embraces cliche as often as it desires to subvert it.
"Goth, Ortega, and Snow all give endearing, dynamic performances."
"X is preoccupied with voyeurism across different generations, bringing together two genres - horror and porn - associated not just with the MPAAs X rating, but also with the male gaze. That gaze will be subverted and skewered..."
"West’s trademark slow build-up gives us every chance to imagine our own version of the mayhem on the way... To hold our attention in the meantime, he has another trick up his sleeve: making his characters sufficiently interesting and likeable."
"A fantastic slasher flick that works on multiple levels, but chiefly at its most important job: slicing and dicing in dizzying delight."
"West's film is meta but not in the painful wink-wink, nudge-nudge jokiness of the Scream franchise. Instead, it's a more subtle way of referencing the horror genre through just the visual look of the location or the costumes or the framing."
"A skillful, clever, not entirely satisfying homage to the heyday of both skin flicks and slasher cinema."
"X is a horrifying and self-aware slasher that knows no film exists in a bubble. It embraces cinematic history, humps it, then slashes its throat."
"The film proves once again if you do a good job mixing sex and violence, you captured Hollywood's winning formula combo"
"Creepy, hilarious, gross...X is a love letter to 70s horror classics but also something entirely fresh and original. "
"The characters (and the performances) are strong enough to make sure this avoids the usual pitfalls that come with making a film about film-making, giving the slaughter just enough of an emotional core to keep it from being a collection of flashy slashes"
West just wants to punish everyone involved in gory ways played for laughs.
X paints the screen with a sensual bloodbath that serves up plenty of well-timed thrills with a harrowing message.
"I expected many things from X, but I didn't expect it to make me cry."
"West effectively rachets up the tension by delaying the requisite bloodletting, which is done with a relative sense of restraint. "
"West has made a rare horror tale that makes you listen, ponder and consider whats happening to its hapless victims, and why."
It's quite a while before the dictates of the genre kick in - and when they do it's with substantial force. 
I had fun with this and easily could see myself watching it again
Director Ti West crafts a blood-soaked tribute to 1970's era slashers while inserting his own thoughtful meditations.
"X has no interest in making any sweeping statement about gender, sexuality, or age. Instead, it strips slasher horror down to its core and reminds us of what it was about the genre that made us love it. It's funny, self-aware, and unashamedly gory.
"
An instant slasher classic. 
"A no holds barred, take no prisoners horror flick that possesses that magical ability to still genuinely (and delightfully) shock and astound you."
"For all its lackadaisical, uncontemporary pace, and lack of most great horror’s gruelling intensity, X remains a satisfying, keenly thoughtful ride."
"It's porny, and it's scary. "
"Between West’s screenplay and a universally strong cast, X is surprisingly affecting."
"Ti West's ""X"" is one of the best slashers I've seen this year. It's not for the faint of heart. Its story shocks but also broadens the horizons and provokes. Worth revisiting, with a soundtrack jam-packed with bangers and performances out of this world."
X provides a map for how to do the classics right while still taking the formula somewhere original.
"X is a whole-hearted homage to the 70s slasher movement. And unlike the majority of its kind, it actually manages to live up to its predecessors."
"X by name, extreme by nature. Ti West's horror comeback doesn't pull any punches and it's full of sex, violence and plenty of great scares."
"""Skewers the soured tropes and sex stereotypes of a certain slasher era..."""
"A true story about a elder who steals a painting in order to help others, demonstrating the philosophy of ubuntu.
"
Broadbent is absolutely wonderful and gives his best performance in many years.
" English comedies seem to have more than their share of eccentric characters in the very distinct British style of humor. Here, British actor Jim Broadbent fills the bill perfectly, playing a real life British eccentric, Kempton Bunton."
"Designed as a crowd pleaser for the silver screen generation, it can feel a little paint by numbers at times. However thanks to the terrific central performances, colourful caper The Duke proves life certainly ain’t grim up north."
"It just doesn’t feel like anybody is on their A-game. ... It's not a grand finale to [Michell's] career; it's like an encore where he plays an endearing crowdpleaser with a simple chorus about making the world a better place, one we can sing along to. "
"Gloriously witty, and comic... wonderful film."
Basically a David and Goliath tale in which the sling and stone are replaced by a cheery attitude and an open heart.
"Directed by the late Roger Michell, this dramatization of the true-life caper of a working-class pensioner stealing a famous portrait and holding it for ransom in exchange for free TV licenses is a simple but charming cup of Northern goodness."
Director Roger Michell's final movie is a charming comedy/drama set in 1961 depicting the infamously true story of how Goya's portrait of the Duke of Wellington was stolen from the National Gallery by an unlikely thief.
"Little is too shaken or stirred, but it all goes down smoothly and delightfully — and with some bite."
"...easy to overlook, but a lot of fun for those who invest their time."
"It’s an old-school British caper in the Ealing Studios tradition, modestly but glowingly crafted and beautifully acted by old pros — and you leave it both buoyant and a little sad. Making that feel easy is hard."
"There are strains of the old Ealing Studios comedies — whimsical tales of plucky Brits taking on the system — running through “The Duke,” a based-on-a-true-story tale that’s enlivened by the pairing of Jim Broadbent and Helen Mirren."
" You won’t catch anyone accusing Roger Michell of being edgy or innovative. But in his last film, the late director pushes an audiences’ buttons with crowd-pleasing precision. "
"The overall feel proves cheery and enjoyable, a likable nod to people with ideas worth sharing."
"The acting is world-class and Oscar-worthy portraying endearingly eccentric characters who sustain an enduring, but slightly demented, relationship. The result is delightful, moving, and richly satisfying..."
“Torn from the headlines” usually indicates a tragedy in the offing. In case of Kempton Bunton it means head-shaking delights.
The Duke is more than just a traditionally made movie about a man who goes on trial for stealing a valuable painting from London's National Gallery. It's also a witty and emotional drama about a family coping with grief. 
"Jim Broadbent delivers a performance that is exactly how we want to see a quirky chap behave. His comic timing is flawless. Helen Mirren has less to do, but she does it brilliantly. "
"Thankfully, The Duke is a middle-of-the-road confection that stays nice and rosy thanks to durable Oscar winners Broadbent and Mirren."
"‘The Duke’ is the final film for prolific stage/screen/TV director Roger Michell, a man who gave jobs to Daniel Craig long before the actor did his 007 thing. Naturally, then, the final shot might leave you nicely stirred while probably not shaken."
"Michell keeps it all moving at a brisk pace, taking an improbable story and adding a few unexpected twists and turns. The Duke is easy to like because of its seemingly effortless charm."
"“The Duke” won’t blow the doors off the multiplex the way “Doctor Strange” will this weekend, but as a good-natured salute to the Kempton Buntons of the world, it’s very satisfying. We need them now more than ever."
"The music, the cinematography, the directing by Roger Michell and the consumate performances all harken back to kinder, more sentimental times when cinema focused on story, character and relationships, and got it all in under two hours."
"Michell adds just enough zippy early-1960s style to evoke the period, without ever distracting from the carefully crafted characters and warm, lived-in performances."
"Ultimately, some may want a bit more from it, but it does have the chance to steal your heart — gone like a painting snatched in the night."
"The Duke may superficially seem like old hat, but in its comfortable ways there’s still a strong message."
"Above all, Dolly and Kempton’s exchanges add true-to-life sparkle. Kristina Hetherington’s editing is inventive, George Fenton’s music has energy, and Mike Eley’s cinematography adds the period ambiance and droll humor of 1950s Ealing comedies."
"Jim Broadbent gives a twinkly, charismatic performance as an obscure Brit raconteur who stole a famous painting, with Helen Mirren as his long-suffering wife."
"A charming, understated and completely enjoyable frolic about how ordinary people can do extraordinary things that seems doubly startling because, while seeming implausible, it also happens to be absolutely true."
"Heartwarming, beautifully shot and more English than a basket of fish and chips with a side of mushy peas, it’s an easy-to-watch, easy-to-love crowd-pleaser."
The duo of Broadbent and Mirren are magnificent to watch together; I appreciated Mirren's restraint as she allowed Broadbent to shine in this excellent heartwarming true story.
"The film has charm to spare, much of that provided by screen veteran Jim Broadbent who’s able to portray Bunton, an eccentric with a heart of gold, without making him look like a fool."
" Its a fizzy, fun little film that I hope isnt forgotten."
"A simple, sentimental story told with panache and cast to perfection"
An irresistible comedy anchored by wonderful performances from Jim Broadbent and Helen Mirren.  
"Stealing from museums may normally be no laughing matter, but here the entire affair is played to the comic hilt, even as it explores more serious issues of income inequality, social class, prejudice, and grief."
"Suffice to say that Broadbent is flawless and lovable, and has the good sense to act as straight man when Helen Mirren, as his beyond fed-up wife Dorothy, hilariously lets rip at him."
"'The Duke' isn't a regal biopic, but it's a lovely one."
The movie qualifies as a solid -- if small -- entertainment that gives Broadbent a showcase role.
... an amusing true-life portrait that balances quirky charm with a more serious examination of sociopolitical issues facing British seniors during the 1960s.
"Far from a great film, it still captures a time, place and group of attitudes to a degree that I found refreshing and thoroughly delightful."
It turns out that watching Jim Broadbent and Helen Mirren costar in this real-life comedy-drama is genuine fun.
"   'The Duke' is a crowd-pleasing, sweet, sentimental and a little messy story about an individual's responsibility to his neighbor, even if the cost is more than he can pay."
"Michell deftly balances the drama and comedy in this bizarre true story... the screenwriters, actors and director collaborated splendidly to craft an ultimately uplifting story tinged with real-life pathos."
"It’s a daft, lovely story, and it opens up like a flower – the final half hour is deeply and unexpectedly moving."
"In the tradition of British heist comedies, and that it really happened, once again proves that truth is as entertaining as fiction. Broadbent is hilarious as the eccentric and very British dreamer, hilarious in the later courtroom scenes. Priceless!"
"THE DUKE is the quintessential British movie --- charming, hilarious and informative. "
"With old pros Jim Broadbent and Helen Mirren heading the cast, along with a smart screenplay, this story fits deservedly into the ""feel good"" genre. "
"It's a combination of situational humor, political commentary, and character study -- all of it equally understated and clever..."
"the filmmakers do a solid job in telling a true-life tale that no one heard about. Well, now you do and it is a good one for us seniors."
"[The Duke] sometimes gets overly sentimental and rose-colored about its “simpler” early 60s milieu, but Broadbent more than carries this homage to the triumph of a little man."
"This messing around with chronology could feel manipulative if the stakes of ""The Duke"" were higher but, instead, it's like each revelation is a little gift."
"A delicious crowd-pleaser in the old Ealing mode, a fact-based dramedy about a little man with a dream who bests the system by sheer pluck. "
"Broadbent always seems to work with a twinkle in his eye and a spring in his step, and his scenes with Helen Mirren make ""The Duke"" just barely bearable."
"The Duke is appealing and wayward, too, if also given to both slickness (split screens? really?) and more than a dollop of sentimentality."
"It's all very sweet and light, with a message about the importance of standing up for one's beliefs at its center. Nothing wrong with that at all."
"Ultimately, “The Duke” tells an enjoyable real-life story."
"If you want pinpoint accuracy, watch a documentary. If you want to see top-notch actors inhabit characters in genuine and ultimately moving ways, The Duke is a much better option."
"Even though it seems like lighter fare, the story has a way of sneaking up on you. "
"It will put a smile on your face, and while its conclusion might feel simplistic, The Duke never promised to tell the truth. It’s got higher aspirations than that."
Broadbent brilliantly plays an endearing character you can't help caring about.
A sweet package made sweeter by two of England’s finest actors.
"This is a great story, beautifully told, combining a do-gooder with a heart of gold with the only theft in the history of the National Gallery."
"Despite its wizened subject and courtroom setting, this comedy-drama has the breezy air of a director in the bloom of youthor of a seasoned artist determined to prove hes still got it. Reader: he does. "
"A carefree way to spend 90 minutes, The Duke won't feel like a theft of any precious family viewing time."
A British period film that deals with working class characters and that actually has a protagonist attempting to wrestle with social issues and effect change is refreshing. Worth watching for Broadbent and Whitehead's performances.
"In the tradition of his earlier work, Michell has elegantly interspersed the intrigue of The Duke with snippets of humor that give everything a laid-back feel. "
"While there’s nothing innately wrong with The Duke, it’s merely an old-fashioned flavor of a film, nothing more."
"As he did throughout his illustrious filmography, in RogerMichell...again peels back the layers of British culture and class, introducing us to characters who are comfortable with the nations stubbornly staid ways and those chafing against it."
There are times I look up at the big screen during a film featuring Jim Broadbent and I simply smile. The Duke is one of those times. 
The Duke caps Michells career in a gently enjoyable manner. 
"Though it lags slightly in the middle, The Duke is an overall delightful depiction of a remarkable true story led by heartwarming performances.

"
"This is an unmistakably British import. Its quiet charm stakes a claim for mature viewers but dont mistake ""offbeat"" for ""bland."" Theres nothing banal or predictable about this lighthearted tale, which is based on a true story.
"
"""The Duke"" is completely agreeable, and pleasant, but it could have been more arch or cynical. This film ends up being as likable as its puckish hero, who gets by on his good will."
"One of the pleasures -- even privileges -- of watching a film like this is seeing what superb actors are able to do with material that doesn’t aspire to greatness. The story is charming, the performances are exceptional."
"Happily, Michell is more interested in the grifter than the grift. And Broadbent, expanding luxuriously into his ideal leading role, is absolutely delightful."
"Their touching chemistry does the trick, and Broadbent is darned near perfect as a man whose Robin Hood-like principles won out in the most unlikely of scenarios."
"Bunton is a rabble-rouser and a compelling hero for this film by the director Roger Michell, who died in September after a career of humanist charmers including ""Notting Hill"" and ""Venus."" It is a pity that the script mires Bunton in a soggy family drama"
"The theft itself, and the subsequent (overdone) trial scene that functions as its prologue and aftermath, are in many ways secondary to the film’s humane charms. What’s best about The Duke are its witty grace notes."
"These visible workings foreground questions about cinema itself that usually get swept to one side, gentle provocations about ethics, truth and lies that could be asked of any film."
"Freedom or art? What if there’s no choice at all? Fearless Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi has endured both house arrest and prison in his tireless quest to tell stories that matter under duress.

"
"No image is innocent, Panahi tells us in this ferocious, non-complacent self-portrait of the artist on the brink of collapse. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The premise aims to be complex, yet I find it perplexing. Anodyne at times. [Full review in Spanish]"
A furious and devastating film. [Full review in Spanish] 
"I’m amazed at how Panahi transforms the truth to tell the truth, creating situations with astringent emotion and sharp political commentary. When censors try to tie his hands, he responds with this: a new gem of Iranian cinema."
A film about the mental and phyisical barriers. A very well written film. [Full review in Spanish]
"A typically tricksy and self-reflective work from Jafar Panahi, No Bears marks the fifth film the Iranian director has made covertly since the authorities banned him from filmmaking and international travel in 2010."
Bear becomes a metaphor for fear. The filmmaker is not frightened of any dire forces. But he is also not willing to flee the consequences of his attempts at truth-telling.
"In the auteur’s latest masterpiece, every moment is suffused with not just purpose, but captivating beauty.
"
"[Jafar Panahi's] latest film, NO BEARS, is an ambitious, powerful piece..."
A startlingly harsh work of self-critique; a two-pronged deconstruction of the artist’s oblivious egotism and bull-in-a-china-shop propensity for leaving devastation in his wake. 
"Panahi deftly juggles his stories, merging them together in the devastating final minutes of “No Bears.”"
Th film demonstrates the way that neorealism can be used to express freedom under even the harshest repression.
"The only happy ending here is that Panahi, against the odds, has made another film, and hopefully will be able to keep making them.  "
"Witty and despairing in equal measure, “No Bears” is a fascinating cinematic layer cake of themes, sorrows, and banked fury."
"No Bears has many shades and moods, from delightful rural comedy to the most serious kind of social concern. And it has the kind of open ending, somehow very stirring, that qualifies as another hallmark of classical Iranian cinema."
"As a character, Panahi is mostly silent; he has little desire to explain himself. No Bears might have benefited from the light touch of 2006’s Offside, although the reasons behind the film’s heavier tone are understandable."
"There is a sense of urgency that underlines the film, as though Panahi – and the audience – are on borrowed time."
"Panahi is a phenomenal talent, and I don’t use that word loosely. He is endless inventive with breadth and depth. He makes films that engage the intellect and the emotions, those rare gifts that the more I think about them, the more the layers peel back."
"In No Bears, as with This Is Not a Film and Taxi before it, Panahi autobiographically prods the very meaning of cinematic intervention and political filmmaking."
"No Bears is primarily a comedy. Yet the bureaucracy, suspicion, and paranoia underlining everything here contextualizes it in the bleak everyday realities of an oppressive society."
The story keeps adding more twists and more layers in this movie-within-a-movie-within-a-movie. It is almost like standing between two mirrors and seeing multiple reflections of yourself.
"A remarkable achievement in modern cinema, No Bears puts forth a voice and message that is loud, clear and undeniable."
A master class in house-arrest filmmaking from Jafar Panahi.
"This film is terrific. What I really appreciate about Panahi... Is that he characterizes himself as something of an accidental disruptor, a curmudgeon. "
"“This Is Not a Film,” “Closed Curtain,” “Taxi” and “3 Faces” have all been brilliant, but “No Bears” transcends them as both outlawed artistry and a moral interrogation of that art itself."
The folly of unfounded traditions
"The oppression that Panahi and his characters endure are, thus, not much more than arbitrary fairy tales: ""Things are this way because we say so."" Panahi is a warrior, continuing to fight against this authoritarian way of thinking."
"Panahi has made a complex, thought-provoking film that raises questions about a filmmaker’s responsibilities and makes you wonder about a society that would put such a gifted artist in jail."
It's a scathing commentary on political and familial oppression packaged as a dual romance on an unavoidable fast-track towards tragedy.
"Despite the film's relative simplicity of narrative, it becomes a deep and considered act of self-reflection..."
"Perhaps what is most remarkable about “No Bears” is how, despite all this heavy-duty baggage, it nevertheless averts despair. The reason for this, I think, is because the director Panahi equates filmmaking, no matter the risks, with freedom."
"Part faux documentary, part film-within-a-film, Panahi’s latest follows a series of seemingly incidental events that coalesce into a subtle and unexpectedly devastating investigation of a director trying to create art under oppression.
"
"'No Bears' is a multi-layered film filled with allegory, humour, and a humanistic outlook... All of Panahi’s work is deliberately political. 'No Bears' remind us that art is political and that in Panahi’s case, it is a necessity."
"Provocative, engrossing and captivating."
"A fascinating, multi-layered fable in which the storytelling techniques of film butt up against the realities of the world."
"There’s no way to watch this film without feeling mournful, or fearing for the man who made it."
"An effective, personalized allegory for the role of cinema within the Iranian theocratic, authoritarian regime and an incisive, yet humanistic indictment of oppression, from a traditional village on up. "
... a journey of self-discovery with a powerful ending that reinforces the acclaimed filmmaker’s refusal to be silenced.
"Iranian Jafar Panahi's No Bears brings to light the suppression of artists in his homeland, who, like him, carry on - a stoic figure shooting, observing, and directing his feature remotely as tensions rise in brutal government suppression and mob rule.  "
[Panahi's] work has not astonished like this in some time.
"Jafar Panahi’s ability to still clearly identify who the real culprits are is an inspiring testament to his clear-mindedness and his unshaken ability to imagine a better, more just world."
"You leave feeling like you’ve just seen a truly extraordinary late work produced by one of the era’s greatest working auteurs, quickly followed by the sense of experiencing a sucker punch."
"If watching a Jafar Panahi film is something of a political act, then it is also a soul-nourishing one."
"Hopefully No Bears is not the final piece of artfully crafted “propaganda” the director is able to make, nor any socially conscious filmmaker currently experiencing suppression in Iran."
"Panahi, whose courage and honesty are beyond doubt, has made a movie that calls those very qualities into question, a movie about its own ethical limits and aesthetic contradictions."
"Fantastic. The story’s twists and turns are never too much or too little. Panahi’s movie-within-a-movie is about two lovers trying to cross a border so they don’t have to live their lives in secret. It might not be vérité, but it feels authentic. "
"Disarming in both his methods and gentle screen presence, Panahi proves a ruthless killer when it comes to delivering dramatic blows."
Jafar Panahi’s latest in his series of dissident films is a model of courage and creative invention.
"Moving, satirical, and frightening in equal measure, No Bears, the latest from currently imprisoned Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi, is one of the finest and most narratively elaborate films of the year."
"It's a fierce critique of small-town traditionalism and religious dogma. But while this is an angry and ultimately devastating movie, it's also a surprisingly playful and inventive one."
"Self-reflexivity has become a key fixture of [Panahi's] work, and by turning the camera on himself, he exposes surprising vulnerabilities. There is courage in centering himself as the object of his dissident gaze, as well as an element of self-criticism. "
"A testament to the power of film to challenge a culture of blind obedience, and also to Panahi’s efforts, as a dissident filmmaker, to build a cinema of defiance against the propagandist film apparatus of the state."
"Mina Kavani as Zara steals the show every time she appears on screen, with her sorrowful anger being excellently portrayed and her monologue one of the best parts of the movie. "
"No Bears has a novelistically detailed eye for the complexities of individual lives under a chillingly cruel regime, but it also finds romance and humanity in the fissures of its painful story. "
"In this startling work, [Jafar Panahi] places the responsibility on ordinary Iranians to act, even if it leads to heartbreak. Because, as with his latest deceptively sharp-edged meta drama, he knows that not every story can have a happy ending."
"Fact and fiction, truth and lies swirl about each other in Jafar Panahi’s latest. The film -- in which Panahi plays a version of himself -- also deals with the age-old conundrum of whether to stay or go."
"Filmed in Panahi’s realist style, which included telling conversations that reveal the cant behind the can-and-cannot dos imposed on free thinkers, No Bears morphs from an amusing satire into a blazing critique of censorship."
Panahi goes at his subjects with an irrepressible cinematic verve that extends from the story and the dialogue to the performances and the very presences of the actors.
"The director’s bravery and ingenuity -- by continuing to create new work, advocate for himself, and also entertain us -- remains an utterly inspiring thing. "
"Given Panahi’s own real-life suffering and repression, it is a testament to his integrity as an artist that he looks so critically at himself and so empathetically at those who are indifferent to, or might even support, his imprisonment."
"Panahi questions his own cinema and, by extension, that of other creators who seek ""social justice"" with their images. Their intentions may be good, but they are exempt from the consequences of their search."
An important film that substantiates its story by juxtaposing it with what the director is currently experiencing.
"A challenging film, made by a surprisingly self-aware filmmaker, who is using his art to talk about himself, about his country, and about the borders that divide us (and have taken away a lot of his freedom for several years). Full review in Spanish."
I admire Panahi as a brave man and a great filmmaker.
"With warmth and precision, No Bear uses its parallel stories to denounce that fear is a threat hung over societies... [Full review in Spanish]"
"No Bears is, without a doubt, a challenging film, but it also holds big rewards for fans of the auteur’s work. "
"It’s an enticing premise that No Bears mostly lives up to ... balancing legitimate thriller set pieces with the restrained self-interrogation that’s defined Panahi’s recent, more confined work in order to ask provocative questions."
"Just the kind of film that makes the long, sleepless travel to reach a far-away film festival worth every minute of its time."
"It isn’t the most thrilling film, but it’s fascinating as a picture of Iran and a portrait of Panahi."
"This hugely involving film uses wry humour to capture cultural absurdities that have an impact on two love stories, while further complicating the process of making movies. "
A piercingly self-aware portrait of an artist who is not afraid to depict himself and his craft as aloof or insular.
Panahi's subdued filmmaking will appeal to an audience that enjoys the director's modus operandi.
"Far from an exercise in indulgent meta navel-gazing, No Bears is a compelling, emotional and humane study of fear, perseverance and resisting oppression through witness. "
"Panahi’s ninth feature, which premiered at Venice in the weeks after its maker’s incarceration, is a thrilling testament to the maxim that necessity is the mother of invention."
No Bears is another subtly momentous entry in the curious and humbly optimistic filmography of one of our greatest working directors.
A dark postmodern satire about the unexpected film that emerges within a film about making a film.
"No Bears is an incredibly poignant and brave statement on both Panahi’s own situation and that of his country, Iran. No Bears has so many layers and says so much."
"In spite of travel bans, house arrests and actual imprisonment... Jafar Panahi has managed to create a body of work that movingly describes life in a censorious theocracy. Banned in Iran, No Bears is a subtle and tricky drama within a drama."
"Through clever subterfuge, Panahi has continued to direct new movies during his ban, of course--good ones, perhaps none so good as his latest..."
"As intense a situation as one could imagine, especially knowing that in this instance, Panahi was not able to continue on like the Duke boys of Near Eastern cinema and elude the totalitarian forces tangling him in their grasp."
"... Its very existence is an act of defiance, a metafictional portrait of a dissident artist still at work. It also has a flavour all its own: a complex layer cake of guilt and suspicion, where even a great shot by a master director is a suspect device.
"
"With his latest film, Jafar Panahi suggests that cinema might be a great art worth fighting for, but it may not be able to save anyone."
"With the exception of the mournful Closed Curtain, No Bears is the gravest of Panahi’s post-arrest work. His usual puckish spirit is channelled here into a structure incorporating fragmented points of view."
"It’s deceptively simple: the more you think about it, the more layers there seem to be and the more you realise how much this film has to say about lives made small by restrictions that can, and do, result in tragedy."
"Panahi covered similar ground in This Is Not a Film, Taxi and 3 Faces, but No Bears has an urgency all of its own."
"Like Panahi’s recent films This Is Not a Film and Taxi Tehran, this is powerful because of its control, subtlety and diplomatic finesse."
The film’s quiet anger and poignancy is even more acute in the wake of Panahi’s recent imprisonment.
"No Bears is one of his most ambitious works yet and while it tackles a number of serious issues, there’s always room for his wry humour."
“No Bears” is one of the year’s best films from one of the most vital filmmakers in the world.
"NO BEARS (2022) Review - Balancing a wry sense of humour with the tragic realities of contrasting elements of Iranian life, Panahi has crafted an honest and introspective work that underscores what he stands for as an artist."
"Pictures here bear witness, act as testimony not only in capturing it but simply in existing; in the conscious reflexivity of No Bears’ own existence..."
"If Panahi’s dissident films have to date been journeys of discovery about the subversively liberating, life-affirming power of cinema, “No Bears” is where he slams on the brakes."
"With No Bears, Panahi reaches the point of self-reckoning, questioning the social validity of his work and confronting the limitations of art."
"The master has left the building, albeit only for a moment. And like any master worth following, he has left behind his most challenging work for us to reckon with in his wake."
"The politics and participants’ backgrounds aren’t spelled out for non-local viewers, and many of the nuances absolutely went over my head. More power to Panahi for that; insisting that cultural specificity be insisted on its own terms is a good..."
No Bears generally spends less time finding aesthetic articulations of its themes than it does building out an increasingly convoluted plot to support them.
"Panahi has not stopped fighting, using cinema as a language to reproduce and further compromise reality, calling the viewing world into account. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Per usual with Panahi, it takes some time to orient oneself in the happenings of No Bears, arguably one of the director's more complex endeavors."
[A] missed opportunity for creating compelling testimony about an authentically dire situation.
"In many ways, Navalny serves as a model for what Amnesty International refers to as ""prisoners of conscience"" as well as an anti-corruption hero."
"Beyond the borderline-profound, right-side-of-history feel of the documentary, Roher is a wily and astute filmmaker. "
"Perhaps Navalny remains unfairly in prison, perhaps Putin is the devil he suggests he is, yet, Daniel Roher's movie is far from proving it. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Usually only Hollywood screenwriters can conjure up a narrative like the one that Navalny has been living, though, typically in a Bourne-style spy thriller."
It is tremendous both in the subject and the craftsmanship with which it has been made. 
"This is fantastic. Essential, urgent, and it couldn't be more relevant. "
"Imagine what a kinder, gentler world we would have today if it was Vladimir Putin languishing in jail rather than Alexei Navalny."
"[Navalny] tries to figure out who exactly was involved, leading to one of the most harrowing and thrilling sting operation calls ever recorded on camera. It's also very funny, only if to see the sheer incompetence of those that tried to kill him."
"Part political portrait, part espionage thriller - containing perhaps the most jaw-dropping phone call in the history of cinema."
"This is not only a moving portrait of a brave opposition leader, but an inside look at the work of effective investigative journalists."
It's the sort of explosive overview that can change minds in a perfect world and the perfect litmus test for exposing sycophants who readily agree with Putin that it's all just an embarrassing cry for attention.
"At once disheartening and inspiring, Navalny is thus a bracing reflection of Russian society and the fraught state of modern democracy at large."
"He isn’t flawless, and the film is damning of his realpolitik approach to coalition-building with some scummy far-right politicians, but he’s an inspiring figure for his sheer fearlessness in the face of tryanny."
Navalny warns that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing.
Navalny is nothing if not efficient in its dramatics.
Navalny knows the power of a compelling narrative and delivers a call to arms...
The fact that it involves one of the most brazen incidents of state sponsored assassination in memory means this is a unique document of a very singular man.
"Even when Navalny goes big, there are still moments of levity."
This never-before-seen footage impressed and amazed us because it's something completely unfathomable.
"Navalny succeeded in waking up the Russian people and the world regarding Putin and for that, he will go down in history as a revolutionary game-changer, not unlike the way we view our own Founding Fathers. He can and should hold his head forever high."
A suspenseful and inspiring tribute to a Russian freedom fighter.
"... Beyond its welcomed denouncing spirit and the possibility of getting to know Putin's biggest opponent, it doesn't quite delve into darker, more disquieting territories. [Full review in Spanish]"
A must-see in our political moment.
...a rare peek behind a new iron curtain that may be rapidly drawing shut.
"Astonishing and downright chilling, Navalny plays out like a tightly wound political thriller with tragic results."
"it's a top-of-the-line thriller, complete with an astonishing central sequence that is jaw-dropping in its audacity and profound in its impact on the world. I suspect that this is exactly the film Alexei Navalny wanted."
The movie is mainly a fleet-footed true-life investigative spy thriller on the botched murder operation.
"“Navalny” is a doc that exposes a shocking series of events, all of which are too mindblowing to reveal "
Daniel Roher’s documentary Navalny is an entertaining and thrilling film about the Russian politician who challenged Putin and paid the price. 
I left feeling hollow and angry. Like I’d been manipulated using methods pioneered and perfected under the long-gone Soviet regime of my childhood.
"It is after all a political whodunnit nestled within a campaign movie about human rights, which may not sound exciting, but it is."
"With talking heads ranging from investigative reporters and Navalny’s family, this was the inside story of a poisoning plot exposed and a chilling look into the moral abyss that is Putin."
"Granted fly-on-the-wall access, the film has a jaw-dropping sequence in which Alexey Navalny prank-calls his own attackers..."
An emotional rollercoaster of a film...
"The laughs kick in early. Navalny does not suffer from false modesty, but he is also smart enough to mock his own swagger... Even the hardships are edged with unlikely amusement."
"Navalny’s resistance cell has a small, charmingly ad hoc air about it. But the film brilliantly captures the innate foolishness of his opponents, too -- the absurdity as well as the darkness. "
"The film was made entirely before the invasion and hasn’t been updated to acknowledge it, but viewed at the present point, it serves not only as an international political thriller but as a kind of elegy to the era of Russian history that has just ended,"
Roher has assembled a tense and absorbing look at Navalny and his inner circle.
"Central to the documentarys structure, and the way it reveals all the facts about Navalny, is the search for the poisoners and the fascinating spycraft surrounding that quest."
"A real-life thriller set against the backdrop of the disinformation wars, Navalny is a lively patchwork of archival and original material, profiling Russias most famous dissident."
"It is more chilling and absorbing than any spy fiction, because it’s all real, and ominous, too."
"This superb documentary demonstrates, even more dramatically than The Death of Stalin or Chernobyl, how dim Russia’s evil rulers are. "
Roher deserves more credit than just being in the right place at the right time ... He assembles Navalny well and draws out figure's charisma in interviews that highlight his leadership skills.
"The attitude of Mr. Navalny and his colleagues is fearless, in a country governed by fear. Thrillers are rarely so inspiring."
"It offers intimate, sometimes amazing access to the bravery, and human cost, of opposing a despot."
One of those rare documentaries that is vitally important as well as entertaining. 
" Riveting cinema, a roller coaster of emotions "
Navalny successfully doubles as an espionage procedural and a portrait of one man’s war against an authoritarian regime. It balances a magazine-style profile and a probing independent inquiry into a brutal state-sanctioned assassination attempt.
"A remarkable, first-hand insight into how a modern-day police state operates, and how any kind of meaningful opposition can exist — as terrifying as it is hopeful."
"We... get a sense of Navalny’s personality (confident, energetic, dry-humoured) and his family life, and we see his wily efforts to identify his poisoners."
"Spectacularly entertaining. As gripping, as suspenseful as a finely wrought fictional thriller; a sheer delight as a portrait of the man himself. Films dont get much more daring or crucial than this."
"The other reason to go see Navalny in a theater, if you can, is for its sheer entertainment value, to be properly immersed in the suspenseful story Roher is telling -- recent history and scarcely believable if this were a Jason Bourne sequel."
Navalny is so taut and suspenseful you’d think John le Carré had left behind a secret manuscript that’s only just coming to light now.
"This chilling and revealing documentary is a must-see piece of filmmaking and with Putins invasion of Ukraine on our minds every day, Navalnys story has an even more powerful impact."
"Whats really good about this documentary is that it doesnt sugarcoat who Navalny is and his past, including excerpts of him talking at far right rallies."
"This is undoubtedly one of the most thrilling documentaries to be released this, or any, year."
"[Blends] biography, activism and a particularly gripping procedural element..."
Navalny already seems like a warning from history three months ago. It’s terrifying that it has already become even more relevant.
"As entertaining as Navalny is, its an urgent reminder that he, and the brighter future he represents for a Russia that is on an increasingly frightening path, not be forgotten."
Daniel Roher’s compelling documentary Navalny intimately reveals the consequences of challenging Vladimir Putin’s autocratic Russia.
A documentary that moves with the swiftness and tension of a crackerjack thriller.
"Daniel Roher’s documentary Navalny is truly a film for our times. It’s a great way to get yourself up to speed on this case if you weren’t paying attention in 2020, as it provides a nice summary of the events of Navalny’s ordeal and world reaction to it. "
"Despite some serious qualms, theres value to the film... For uninformed viewers, even a CliffsNotes version of recent history is better than nothing, and if the film brings increased attention to Navalnys plight, all the better."
"For so many reasons, Navalny’s story concerns us all."
"Although the story of Russian political activist Alexei Navalny has been widely reported in the news, the documentary Navalny is a wild and intriguing look at what went on behind the scenes when he tried to find out who poisoned him in 2020."
"It’s a genuinely exciting piece of storytelling, a propulsive real-life quest for truth driven by ingenious tech-geeks and the disarming force of Navalny’s personality."
An astonishing account...
A fascinating documentary about the now-imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny...
"A brave film about a brave man, made with the urgent purpose of one of Navalny’s YouTube exposés and a vivid sense of what cinema can still achieve."
"An exciting and urgent documentary by Daniel Roher... This cinematic portrait of the bravest man on earth will burnish Navalny’s profile and slightly increase the pressure on Putin to let Navalny go free, or at least to let him live."
"The film ends with Roher asking Navalny, months ago, in the emptied-out barroom setting of most of their exchanges, What do you think about the wars in Syria and Ukraine? His answer is genial, blunt, startling. Navalnys words are a big, fat f-you."
"Real-life intrigue  including Navalnys Russian return after being poisoned  is  more outrageous than any fiction, because his status as martyr is the lubricant that could loosen the iron grid that Putin has on his country and the rest of the world."
"While Navalnys story continues, he will continue to live in infamy as Rohers timely film will have his fearlessness and fight embedded in history forever."
Navalny is a riveting and powerful documentary about the political and social battles worth fighting for...A must-see documentary.
Rohers film is at turns enlightening and emotional...it is also alarming and downright hilarious.
With CNNs resources Roher has created a documentary that is both an active record and testament to democracy.
"Navalny is a sketch of a brilliant, exuberant politician and a spycraft thriller, with a tragic ending. Who could ask for more absorbing TV?"
What comes through most clearly in Daniel Roher's semi-hagiographic documentary about... Alexei Navalny are the particular traits one must possess in order to challenge a power-mad despot like Vladimir Putin.
"When this was all happening it made no sense why Alexei Navalny would risk everything to return to Russia. What this film does is present why, in his mind, he had no choice but to return, no matter what the consequences are."
The sequence in which he essentially prank-calls one suspect and tricks him into revealing pretty much everything may well be one of the most astonishing and spellbinding things that you will see in a film this year.
Roher turns the film into a cerebral John le Carre-like thriller...
"Navalny is a masterclass in documentary storytelling, Emotional and distrurbing in equal measure, this is one of the most jarring, hard to believe stories ever seen on film."
A shocking recounting of Russian reform leader and Vladimir Putin opponent Alexei Navalnys poisoning. 
"""Navalny"" paints a portrait that takes you beyond the headlines and showcases an impassioned, courageous, and principled man brave enough to stand up to Russia's authoritarian leader, Vladimir Putin  and who nearly died because of it."
"They don't make espionage pictures like they used to. Then again, here's Navalny, which could easily pass for a Costa-Gavras political thriller or the next Bourne chapter."
It is potentially a landscape-altering piece of work that transcends film festival fame and stands as a stirring nutshell of humanitarian history.
"Watching Navalny, you feel like you are witnessing history. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Roher is profoundly lucky to have been around when Navalny's harrowing story needed to be told, and so are we."
"Even with a foregone conclusion, Roher's movie has the feel of a gripping political thriller. Credit the drum-tight editing by Langdon Page and Maya Daisy Hawke, and the intriguing cast of characters."
Navalny is a riveting examination of a seemingly fearless public figure.
A pointed and unnerving must see biopic documentary of the 45-year-old Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in the aftermath of being poisoned.
"Navalny has the flow and tension of a thriller, and it has a central figure whose refusal to bend remains uncompromised even behind bars."
"There is something brutally honest about ""Navalny"" as a high-wire act. The film strikes a singular balance between fearlessness and hopelessness, forcing us to reckon with why he put himself in that position, to not only grieve when he falls."
"Offers hope for a brighter, freer future in Russia amid the ongoing shock of state cruelty."
"Navalny is fearless, charismatic and an agent of history. Roher's timely doc puts us right there with him."
"Navalny is a bracing document of the assassination attempt on Navalny's life, as well as his victorious post-recovery effort to unmask those behind it."
"It's a swift, inspiring, propulsive film with a dashing and intelligent central figure enacting a drama that he can't possibly win, except for a freak of luck or in the eventual annals of history."
"If Tom Clancy or John le Carré fabricated the events depicted in Daniel Roher's documentary Navalny, you'd think it was too on-the-nose."
A must-watch documentary...
"Tightly constructed, and its sharp, witty script elevates the already fascinating and dedicated performances. Official Competition is a fiery satire and one of the funniest films I have seen this year so far."
"As a satire, Official Competition is a mixed success, since it's rarely as laugh-out-loud funny as intended, though it's never less than entertaining. "
These are easy targets although there’s a lot of enjoyment to be hand in seeing them hit so accurately.
Fans of Hollywood-insider flicks like The Player and S.O.B. should dig this lively endeavor.
Official Competition is such a fascinating film that can either be watched with a bowl of popcorn or a notepad and pen and a glass of wine.
A biting satire... an Oscar-worthy send up of Oscar-worthy films.
"With career-best comic performances, Cruz, Banderas, and Martínez wring laughs from the most subtle looks and gestures."
"If there is one ingredient that gives this film its peculiar appeal, it’s the spectacle of actors playing actors."
"Official Competition is – like the film-within-a-film it focuses on – overwhelmingly an actor’s picture and Cruz, Banderas and Martínez are at ease throughout."
"Cruz, with her cascading curls, hipster eyeglasses and eccentric outfits, has a ball with the highminded, driven Lola as she pushes her actors to increasingly absurd degrees."
"While not on the level of Robert Altman’s The Player, Official Competition is an observant send up of the self-importance of the festival circuit. Cinema buffs may squirm at the derision, but few can deny the accuracy of this caricature."
"It’s comedy with an edge, a more than satisfying ending and a haunting final image."
"Official Competition features lots of talk about creativity and commerce, art and life, but with its offhand absurdities and low-key critiques of pretension and vanity, it’s also laugh-out-loud funny."
"All in all, Official Competition is a fun and mature look at the film industry, or more specifically, the individuals within it and their motives. "
[A] playful and intelligent film.
"For most of the runtime, the viewer enjoys the weird and idiosyncratic behaviors on display—made all the better because they’re brought to life by three incredible actors."
I enjoy that Official Competition really sends up that kind of brooding artist persona.
"This movie-making industry satire is witty, intelligent and saved from potentially unbearable navel-gazing by the warmth, talent and sheer charismatic chemistry of Cruz and Banderas."
"Cruz's eye-catching sartorial style is marvellous, and the cast sends up the industry, and themselves, magnificently."
"The directors/screenwriters,  Gastón Duprat and Mariano Cohn, take the challenge to bring to life a deeply intelligent script. ""Official Competition"" will make you think about your internal demonds, your ego and the (...). [Full review in Spanish]"
"Gaston Duprat and Mariano Cohn’s Official Competition may be yet another satire on filmmaking, but it’s the rare iteration that’s nuanced enough to understand that self-awareness does not equal absolution."
"It dismantles the lofty ambitions of cinema as great, important and significant, a monument on the cultural landscape. Instead, it shows us art for ego’s sake, and it has a lot of wickedly spiteful fun doing so."
"This is a marvellous film, witty, eccentric and full of hidden depths. Cruz delivers a lovely turn as the inscrutable, free-spirited Lola, and Antonio Banderas’ Félix is a sublimely subtle comic creation."
"Official Competition is being touted as “biting satire”. But herein lies a problem. None of the characters has been drawn to create any empathy, while the script feels bitty, giving us a series of point-proving pay-offs. "
"[Cruz] has rarely been stronger on screen, as an idiosyncratic martinet who nonetheless finds moments of genius and tenderness between her leading men. A blast."
"Joyful, with outstanding performances, but for such a sharp, witty script it’s a shame the momentum fizzles out towards the end."
"Official Competition is a wicked satire on the art of fine filmmaking, which allows three great actors to have a hoot — along with the audience."
An uproarious comedy that’s also deliciously well-performed... this Spanish-language gem cleverly gets away with being both roast session and sneaky celebration at once.
Mariano Cohn and Gastón Duprat adeptly keep the comedy deadpan and timed with enough precision to prevent the film feeling like a long sketch from a TV variety show.
"The gags and targets are too obvious to generate big laughs, but the darker turns the film takes, together with the changing registers of the performances (what starts as farce veers more towards tragedy) redeem it somewhat."
"You’d watch this dream team share the frame in anything, let alone one of the year’s most riotously funny comedies."
"Official Competition appears at first to be a standard movie-business takedown à la The Player, but it has far more faith in the art form than that. Among its tastiest pleasures is the chance to see Cruz and Banderas sparking together on screen at last."
"It’s a very funny film, sending-up human absurdities without being too mean. Cruz is a talented comedian, but she smartly plays it straight-ish here."
"By the time the film reaches an unexpected climax, any empathy for their endeavour becomes lost, and Official Competition becomes a flat satire, despite the actors’ best efforts."
"Simply impossible to look away from... As Lola, Cruz is a 'find yourself someone who can do both'-kind of marvel."
"You know how most of the foreign language movies we get in the US are weighty, meaningful dramas? This one isn’t that. This one’s enjoyably silly."
"Cruz, Banderas and Martínez are fantastic in this hysterical satire on the film industry and the battle of egos between artists. [Full Review in Spanish]"
It remains a fun Spanish comedy but the blunt way it is told means it is not quite a classic filmmaking parody.
"While the film pokes fun at the pretensions of filmmaking, it careful to keep matters grounded; the shenanigans might be heightened for comic purposes but they feel real enough so that when things go to extremes they hit home."
"An absolutely hilarious (and freely silly) tangle of ego and creative chaos, and I'm not just talking about Penelope Cruz's hair. "
"It's a particularly European -- or in this case, Argentine-European -- approach to showbiz satire that's resistant to taking sides in debates over the ethics of art and performance, an ambivalence that's as satisfying as it is slippery."
"In between the comic highlights, the script succeeds in planting some surprisingly revealing insights about the vanities and illusions of the theatrical life. It’s a very clever film."
"The mood du jour is lights, camera, crazy in a Spanish masterclass on how not to make a movie."
Like many satires Official Competition feels like it could only have been made (and maybe fully appreciated) by people who love what is being mocked.
"Official Competition is a bit long and could have used some more of the offbeat humor that it excels at. But overall, it’s a worthwhile journey into pulling back the curtain satirically on movie magic."
A silly but funny film.
"You’ve seen most of these jokes before, but never quite like this."
Cruz gives a great performance.
The actors involved are obviously game to poke fun at themselves. It is a bitingly funny journey through the filmmaking process.
"Official Competition is a sneaky movie—an elegant, seemingly detached objet d'art that nonetheless delivers some of the biggest laughs I've had all year. "
"Official Competition drags on for a little longer than it should, but this slightly offbeat comedy/drama has some sharp observations about how celebrities can be coddled and exploited in the movie industry."
A feast for actors about actors.
"The film attacks the three protagonists' clashing egos and lands in a fun, fascinating, and uncomfortable [farce]. [Full review in Spanish]"
"As the art of filmmaking takes a punch in the face, audiences will love the pummeling and laugh themselves silly."
Penelope Cruz is a beast as Lola.  From the styling of her character to her off the rails portrayal of holding the audience captive alongside co-stars Antonio Banderas and Oscar Martìnez who are equally brilliant as they collectively blaze the industry
"Boasting some of the funniest sight gags alone, the best of them all may just be Antonio Banderas reacting towards and even instigating the egotistical attitudes that sometimes becomes the story we remember within art."
"A sly, witty and perceptive take on the foibles of actors and filmmakers, with a trio of outstanding performances brilliantly complementing and supporting each other.  "
"A lacerating — yet, oddly, still loving — satire of how movies are made. "
"Penelope Cruz is on fire with this role, showing off her chops spectacularly as a film director whose manipulations come back to bite her, and overall the film is an absurd and farcical trip, the artistic vision of a movie within a movie outside a movie. "
"For movie lovers, this hilarious comedy is a Master Class in satire seeing actors and their director put their egos center stage in an outlandish, outrageous exaggeration of the film business. "
"You can tell Cruz, Banderas and Martinez are all having a blast in Official Competition completely selling out to the absurdity and willing to be part of the joke. Their willingness to go all-in is quite infectious."
"What’s unexpected about the film is the length to which Cuevas, Félix and Iván manipulate each other -- in cruel, witty and inventive ways. "
"Oscillating between a dark comedy and drama, it examines the quirks and eccentricities of its characters as they clash toward one shared goal."
"A clever stab at the entertainment industry, the filmmaking process and some examples of the egocentric players that form it. Includes top-notch performances from Penélope Cruz, Antonio Banderas and Oscar Martinez. [Full review in Spanish]"
“Official Competition” is an observant lampoon that will work best for movie buffs. 
"A riot. It’s primarily an insider comedy about making a movie, but the strokes are broad enough that anyone can play. "
It’s a tour de force by Cruz with the guys there to support her mission – not that she needs it.
"Official Competition pulls back the curtain to let us glimpse creation, in all its messiness, at work."
"Sharply written and consistently funny, Official Competition (horrible title, by the way) may be a notch too acerbic for casual moviegoers. But for those of us who read the trades and know an actor or two, it’s catnip."
Chronicle humans at their worst... with visual wit and from a wry remove.
"Not only one of the best films of the year and one of the best satires I've seen on art, it's also a sharp reflection on the human inability to accept different perspectives when you're sure you're absolutely right. Full review in Spanish."
Fascinating and subtly hilarious.
Makes for a delightful satire and is always entertaining.
"This intriguing black comedy from Spain pits Penélope Cruz, Antonio Banderas and Oscar Martínez as a daring director who casts antagonistic actors in her latest film."
"It satirises, with a certain subtlety, the egotism of the actors and the vanity of the entertainment industry, with three more than pleasant central performances by Antonio Banderas, Penélope Cruz and Óscar Martínez. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Cruz, Banderas, and Martinez are having a ball here, relishing the opportunity to take the piss out of the ‘types’ they’re playing. Each of them drolly underplays, and are crackerjack at doing the physical comedy as well as the wordplay. "
"This is like comedy for the mind. But whatever you want to call it, it’s intellectually satisfying, in that it presents a skewed but unified vision of reality."
"“Official Competition” might not say anything new or groundbreaking about art imitating life or unorthodox filmmakers, but at least it features three prominent actors at the top of their games. "
"A very funny, sometimes thoughtful examination of the ways the tensions of real life can end up informing a film project. "
"Official Competition is a twisted and oddball satire on moviemaking, ego, and the creative process. The banter is like something out of The Odd Couple, if only The Odd Couple had been written by Edward Albee instead of Neil Simon."
"Its dark humour might be best suited to that rarefied [film] fest-mosphere, but it should still manage to find fans at the multiplex who are looking for something a little meta, a little subtitled and a little rough."
Cast makes this limp comedy about actors and filmmaking worth while.
"Official Competition puts ego-driven film stars under the microscope and the result is brilliantly, uncomfortably, and scathingly funny and real."
"There is much to appreciate in the situations, even if the writers (Cohn and Duprat, joined by the latter’s brother, Andrés) aren’t quite as witty as they think they are. In that, they have a lot in common with their characters, at least."
Penélope Cruz and Antonio Banderas make the most of showbiz types in a satire about making movies. 
"I’d call Official Competition’s satire wryly amusing rather than belly-laugh producing, but no complaints from this quarter -- that’s exactly the tone the directors Mariano Cohn and Gastón Duprat are going for, and they pull it off very nicely indeed."
We get a clash of creative personalities combined with the nuts and bolts telling of how-to-make-a-movie that ring real.
"As much fun as Cruz is clearly having, and that’s a lot, Banderas may be having even more."
"Poking fun at the process of making a prestige film, this Spanish comedy has a consistent bone-dry wit."
"Three incredible performances make this hilariously dark send-up of the film industry entertaining from start to finish, though it might not be every viewer's cup of tea."
"A sly satire of cinema that also manages to be a showcase for the comedic chops of its stars: Penélope Cruz, Antonio Banderas and Oscar Martínez."
Penélope Cruz underscores that she can just do anything. She is so funny in this. 
"Everyone is so, so funny in this. I love this stage of Cruz's career. "
OFFICIAL COMPETITION is definitely my kind of movie. It’s darkly entertaining with incredible acting --- and writing. 
"OFFICIAL COMPETITION is rich with many ironies piled on top of one another, but it would be inadequate and a disservice to the clever script to try and explain the intricate scenarios within."
"The Player may have been rotten to the core, but this leaves a little room for humanity and it’s there, as Iván and Félix battle for our sympathies, that it succeeds.
"
Official Competition may not expand your view of filmmaking. But the movie proves entertaining and funny and Cruz and her two compatriots work at levels that fill Official Competition with enjoyment.
"Cohn and Duprat are deliberately, deliciously playing into this discussion of talent vs. fame.... Banderas gives a sly, knowing performance that shows he knows exactly how vainglorious Félix can be"
Cruz slyly pits a pair of egomaniacal actors against each other...in this satirical bonfire of hubris.
"Cruz, Antonio Banderas, and Oscar Martínez continue to prove how versatile they are as actors, shifting from comedy to drama on a dime and making it all work seamlessly."
"There’s a vulnerability in every aspect of the film that makes it endearing, essential viewing."
"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande plays out in a conventional way that resembles that of a theatre play because of its intimate nature and attention to dialogue, but that is actually a bold choice"
It is a two-hander that could have been easily a stage play but director Sophie Hyde and writer Katy Brand take risks to deliver this charming exploration of human desires between two top performing actors. 
"Great performances 
Engaging dialogue 
And a charming feature "
"The most significant achievement of Good Luck to You, Leo Grande is the film's impressive ability to create a safe environment where the often uncomfortable topics become comfortable within everyday conversation."
A movie that so welcomingly embraces body positivity through sensual intimacy — in a culture where body image is such a pressing issue — is a goddamn treasure and deserves to be lifted up. 
"There's too much foreplay in this portrayal of repression as the enemy of fulfillment, but Leo Grande also finds wit, charm, and a seamless mix of laughs and pathos along the way. It's informed by kindness and respect."
"Ironically enough such movies are slotted as niche, but the emotion here is universal."
The two leads are terrific in a witty sex-positive bedroom farce that seduces and satisfies.
"A very likable sample of a periodic rarity, a first-rate film actress making a serious film about female sexuality with as much frankness and even nudity as the era will permit."
"This little film is one huge step forward in sex positive cinema. I honestly want to recommend it to everyone, no matter how experienced they may be with sex already. Everyone can learn something from this."
Daryl McCormack graced us with stellar performances...
"More than a mere philosophical exercise, Good Luck to You, Leo Grande is sweet, sexy, and certainly the new favorite film of Father Intintola from The Sopranos."
"Hyde splashes the story with sincere, touching, and sparkling moments that invite empathy, approaching emotions not yet discovered with caution.  [Full review in Spanish] "
"If we ever had a preconceived idea of ​​the patterns that govern a relationship, it's very likely that this film will transform it, with its risky subject, experimental tone, and theatrical style. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Leo tells Nancy he is there to fulfil her fantasy, but she is compelled to keep digging obsessively in search of reality. "
"An unconventional, “march to its own beat” film that slowly lays into you, story-wise. The beginning is simple and interesting enough for most proper age groups to digest it, which helps the buy-in factor when the tone gets more serious.  "
"A tennis match of gestures and talks, and if it reaches fruition is because the performers escalate towards similar heights: he, with forced and yapping gallantry; her, with the dramatic flair of wearing her emotions on her skin. [Full review in Spanish]"
Never mind 'Good.' It's Great. 
"Emma Thompson shines… becoming a revolutionary, subversive, and necessary character.  [Full review in Spanish] "
"The pleasure of this film isn’t really in identifying with Nancy’s sexual awakening … It’s the way Leo and Nancy anticipate and evade each other’s judgments, as the power balance shifts back and forth between them."
There's not a wrong note between McCormack and Thompson.
"a riveting encounter between two strangers, illuminated by brilliant performances from Emma Thompson and Daryl McCormack… takes an adventurous route to depict an older woman’s search for sexual pleasure"
"Sex comedies have rarely felt so lived in, so comfortable, so earnest or so nuanced, or like such a release."
"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande is a deeply sensual film."
Emma Thompson's winning nature as a performer helps sustain this two-hander with good intentions and a wobbly tone.
You could call Brand’s script an exercise in delayed gratification except that it elevates the delay itself into an entertaining and perceptive exploration of eroticism and its many subtleties.
"With a complete lack of visual spice, it might've been better as play."
"There is simply not enough information about Nancy to explain how a woman of her age, education and relative attractiveness, living in an open society and working as a professional educator, could find herself in such a sexually unfulfilled situation."
"In increasingly puritanical times where sex and even mature conversations about sex are almost absent from mainstream cinema, it is so refreshing to be gifted a film that treats the topic with the respect and joy that it deserves."
"The most seductive element of “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande” is the honesty it brings to Nancy and Leo in the first two acts. It isn’t until the clunky final chapter that a frustrating sense of artificiality creeps in."
"Deftly handled direction from Sophie Hyde and a thoroughly impressive dual performance from Emma Thompson  and Daryl McCormack enlivens an electric script, tackling taboo sexual subjects with wit, flair and welcome realism."
"Hilarious and heartrending, this might just be the best movie of the year so far."
Emma Thompson is a one-woman whirlwind as a retired schoolteacher with desires above and beyond the classroom.
"The film connects with its audience through laughter and pain. However, character development isn't as convincing. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Predictable and suffocating in an enclosed setting where two protagonists, face to face, run their lines towards an inexorable, calculated exercise of reciprocal catharsis. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Nothing boils, either literally or metaphorically, because everything's made just right so it doesn't scorch, and then, a delicious, warm infusion can be enjoyed. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A somewhat naïve, politically correct, and sentimental contemporary reversal [Rom Com] in the vein of Pretty Woman and The Graduate, Good Luck to You, Leo Grande sustains itself on two extraordinary performances. [Full review in Spanish]"
... An intimate and personal experience that's particularly insightful and charming. [Full review in Spanish]
"Strenuously overacted, the film is more interested in being topical and “sex positive” than engaging and original."
"The feature film investigates the sensuality and intimate desires of the characters, doing it in a respectful way, without falling into the explicit.  [Full review in Spanish] "
"Sophie Hyde delivers a thoroughly charming (and thoughtful) two-hander with Good Luck to You, Leo Grande..."
"I like the title they went with, but I have no idea how they resisted not calling it Let’s Talk About Sex, because that is 80% of the movie."
"It certainly helps if you like dialogue-heavy films but, if not, don’t be put off, Good Luck to You, Leo Grande is brave, funny, sensitive, and challenging - but oh so good at the same time."
"Leo Grande is a compelling coming-of-age tale that lets us peer into the fragile, fractious process of confronting shame about sex, and a woman's journey..."
"Nancy Stokes is a retired religious education teacher, mother of two adult children, and recently widowed. You might think that sex would be low on her list. You’d be wrong. And it would be particularly wrong to miss this smart, sweet, funny film."
"Good Luck to You, Leo Grand is that rare film that marries goodness and mercy with womanly wit."
"The result defies mass media expectations of poster girls, instead providing a rare cinematic opportunity to deal with reality."
"Good Luck has worthwhile ideas to explore about sex, aging and body acceptance."
"Emma Thompson dazzles in this poignantly honest, tenderly erotic dramedy, aimed at mature audiences."
"Viewers who accept the film's staginess will be rewarded, though, because Brand and Hyde give the actors opportunities to shine while avoiding the largest potential pitfalls in the material."
An entertaining comedy with great performances from the leads that affirms both body and sex positivity.
"Although this is primarily a two-hander, we don’t feel trapped, because the company is enjoyable and the banter entertaining."
"This wholly sex-positive film is itself as unpredictable in its subtleties as it is powerful in its exploration of compassion, body image, ageism, and outdated social ideas about pleasure."
"It's alternately riveting, amusing and hard to watch. Never before have we seen such a compelling portrayal of a middle aged woman’s sexuality."
The compositions are of professional quality and the simple luxury provided by the art department–the movie is set mostly in a chic but practical hotel room–add texture.
"Critics are fawning over Good Luck to You, Leo Grande for its “brave” sex positivity. But the crowd-pleasing comedy is actually anxiously prescriptive, and it relies on an angelic and selfless sex worker to teach a middle-aged woman how to love her body."
"Full of honesty and humanity, utterly lacking in shame over a basic human need, the female experience of which is almost universally ignored onscreen. Light, funny, diverting. So why was I bawling?"
"""Good Luck” reveals itself to be not just an exchange of bodily fluids, but an exchange of ideas offering insights into the power of intimacy and human connection."
It’s the film’s frank and honest discussion of sex and female desire that makes Leo Grande so enjoyable. 
... does it all with true empathy and a pleasantly warm regard for the joy of sex.
Fairly corny with a constructed feel to it--and a bit script-y--but still a solid comedy/drama with substantive themes elevated by the two  leads. 
Thompson...radiates an honesty that is as endearing as it is insightful.
A smart and irresistible adult comedy driven by Emma Thompson's sensational performance. [Full Review in Spanish]
"This is a fearlessly raw performance, and Thompson never overplays her hand."
"Sophie Hyde’s well-lit modern interiors look crisp enough to be engaging without overwhelming the foreground where we’re frequently viewing our half-clothed characters sharing their innermost secrets, though not their names."
The film supposedly bypasses the ickiness of a conventional prostitution story by putting female pleasure at the centre of the action. But it’s still a kind of pleasure that depends on cash changing hands.
he strength of Leo Grande is that it’s about how sex can lead to self-discovery and self-acceptance.
" Good Luck is a two-person show, and its success hinges on the chemistry between Thompson and McCormack; thankfully, that chemistry is easy and abundant, as Leo and Nancy quietly change one another’s lives in this honest, intimate dramedy."
 Sophie Hyde’s [film is] delightful -- and sneakily radical.
"The film is playlike in structure and works because of its capable leads, delicately meted emotional rawness and a vulnerability well mixed with moments of giddy whimsy and palpable passion."
"Emma Thompson unapologetically illustrates the beauty of embracing sexuality with a younger man in all its awkwardness, intrigue and vulnerability.  This a strong-willed rally cry to embrace your body will all the lumps, pooches and flaps with pride."
I thought it would be just two-dimensioned but I was wrong. The bond that develops between the two characters as Leo frees Nancy’s hidden spirit for adventure in a sweet and charming way.
"The film does Disneyfy the sex industry slightly, but the dialogue is pretty good, and Thompson and McCormack bring compelling naturalism to their roles."
"Thompson makes it crackle, and McCormack gives as good as he gets with a graceful turn as a young man harbouring some serious baggage."
"The observations are insightful and sharply important, as are the bravely transparent performances from the two lead actors."
"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande presents a compelling contrast to the scores of coming-of-age movies. Because it’s not about misguided youth blossoming into self-actualization. It’s about self-actualization after a life of regret."
"Thompson is operating at a level we haven't seen from her since at least Angels in America... It's further proof, if you needed any, that she's one of the greatest screen actors of all time. "
"Given the habit of cinema to depict the sex industry as nothing more than an exploitative hellscape, it’s very welcome to see it used as the backdrop for a genuinely sweet comedy."
"A film with a refreshingly frank view of sexuality is quite a rarity. It’s even rarer that the script, direction, and performances all mesh so well together in a breezy 97 minutes! The chemistry between the two leads is wonderful to watch."
"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande is a sentimental film from writer Katy Brand that shines even brighter thanks to the film’s limited setting. "
"It's like a really well-written play... It's disarming, surprising, and thought-provoking. "
"You can know all about sex and nothing about pleasure, and that’s the distinction that Good Luck To You, Leo Grande explores with a keen eye and a big heart. "
Manages to keep one foot firmly on the floor of enjoyably progressive entertainment even as it dances around a peculiarly British minefield in which anxiety and openness about intimacy collide.
"GOOD LUCK TO YOU, LEO GRANDE tackles one of the last taboo subjects: the sexuality of older women. "
"Sex Work Is The New Black Mammy. And elephants in the room of invisible blackness, the 'happy slave' to only fulfill the white characters, the sexualized black male caricature - and buying a sex toy instead of all the cash spent on this pointless movie."
...if you can find better than Emma Thompson and Daryl McCormack you’d just be showing off. Wouldn’t you? The characters they portray are beautifully broken and their onscreen duet is magnetic in its dissonance.
"Where some viewers will immediately implode with pearl-clutching outrage hellbent on voicing warped decency and unfair determinations, others will be ignited by the possibilities of this premise and the talent involved."
'Leo Grande' features a pair of truly grand performances in a two-hander of four acts (and sorry if we're talking both theatrical and sexual connotations here).
Emma Thompson and Daryl McCormack are incredibly winning in this warm and authentic tale of contentment vs. fulfillment and the never-ending anxiety of chasing just a little bit of pleasure for oneself. 
"Thompson has always been a terrific actor, but she reaches a new plane here, a place where her vulnerability as a person and her confidence as a performer mesh into something glorious."
"In a very British fashion, eroticism is undercut by constant embarrassed comedy. The nation hasn’t moved quite so far from Carry On as the film pretends."
"Not as taboo as you might think, but more of a character study with a fantastic and vulnerable performance by Emma Thompson."
An anti-romcom skillfully treading the line between loveliness and raunchiness while busting through Hollywood conceptions about leading ladies of a certain age.
"Fronted with phenomenal chemistry and performance from Thompson and McCormack, its intimate subject matter explodes on screen, challenging a variety of stigmas while welcoming its audience to enjoy the experience."
"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande is a dramedy shot during the pandemic that demonstrates, with the right actors and the right story to tell, you don’t need much more than a stylish hotel room to make magic."
The story evolves in predictable ways but McCormack and Thompson keep things real.
"Those expecting a feel-good sex-positive film won’t be disappointed, but “Good Luck To You, Leo Grande” is a deeper and richer film that’s about more than how Nancy got her groove back."
"Good Luck to you, Leo Grande is gently empowering in its lack of judgment. It’s a refreshing alternative to a discourse frequently dominated by puritanical avoidance."
Director Sophie Hyde and writer Katy Brand beautifully explore aging women’s desires and needs and what it means to finally love yourself. Emma Thompson and Daryl McCormack’s chemistry is intense and each give brilliant performances.
"And while the story is bombastic, is still better than aliens. With that in mind, I'll give the film a B-, its not perfect, but if you settle in, you can enjoy one last adventure."
"Despite the weirdly ambivalent headlines and mixed reviews dogging this film since its bow at Cannes, this is one of the most consistently enjoyable legacy sequels of recent years."
It’s fun; it’s wacky; it works.
"The final Indiana Jones entry is actually near the top of what is a usually dismal filmic phenomenon: closing chapters of long-running action vehicles. But what's missing is any sense of urgency in the story, or any sense of charisma from Ford himself."
"has enough throwback charm, humor, and attention to character that it comes close to earning its spot in a franchise that frankly should have ended with Indy riding off into the sunset in Last Crusade"
"Without Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is just a professional and innocuously pop-corn movie: a compilation of ""greatest hits"" by an emblematic character of a type of cinema that is fading away. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It may have squiffy CG, a perhaps too extended opening, and repetitious set pieces of evasion and capture, but Mangold sticks the emotional and thematic landing ... "
"The acting throughout “Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny” is solid and the special effects are, as expected, state of the art. Composer John Williams is present for the musical thrills.
"
"This a movie for the nostalgia-minded. Between the score and extensive de-aging of Harrison Ford from 79 years to 37, it’s as if we weren’t 42 years from Raiders of the Lost Ark and we can almost feel like we’re watching installments filmed back to back."
"Dial of Destiny manages to be the complete opposite — the rare legacy sequel content with simply saying goodbye. Telling a poignant story about our relationship with nostalgia and how attempts to cling to the past prevent us from living in the present.
"
"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is cluttered and visually problematic, but never hopeless."
The terrible final act torpedoes any chance of this film being deemed worthy of the franchise.
"The exaggerated plot that seems without rhyme or reason, prevents you from savoring it to the fullest. It may be the nostalgia of the well-thought-out movies of the saga, but ""The dial of destiny"" fails at that important point. {Full Review in Spanish}

"
Considering the gravitas of Ford’s performance — which channels such profound grief — the disconnectedness between his acting and the rest of the film only serves to underline how the movie fails in reconciling with death. 
Dial of Destiny delivers on all its promises from breathless action and the sweetest love story (Indy travels with Marion’s photograph) to a historical Macguffin with a touch of supernatural and finished with that rousing score from John Williams.
"Not much has changed for Indiana Jones. Admittedly, the relic in question is more niche than the Ark or the Holy Grail — but otherwise, The Dial of Destiny is right in the mold of every other Indiana Jones installment, a swashbuckling adventure film."
The latest offering is entertaining but there’s no real magic. It is a production that hits all the right nostalgic notes despite a script that stumbles between paying homage to past works and trying to bring some originality to the tale.
The genuinely entertaining beginning (featuring younger Indy fighting Nazis) and heartfelt final sequence are excellent. It’s what falls between these bookends that grows tiresome. 
"Harrison Ford as the archeologist icon has a grizzled, grumpy sort of melancholy that refuses pity, self or other, for a failing body and life. It is the saving grace of a film that at times falls into a simulacrum of what the franchise should deliver."
Proves that sometimes it is best not to unearth the relics of the past in the corrosive air of a creatively corrupt present.
What works is Ford’s portrayal of disheartened man of conviction who has watched the world achieve its greatest triumphs and commit its worst atrocities.
There’s little point in poring over the Indiana Jones stories as if they were manuscripts in need of decoding. The pleasure of these movies is the non-stop action. 
It had all of the things you want from a great Indiana Jones films.
"Science and history are at the forefront of this epic tale, delivering a worthwhile quest for Mikkelsen and Ford to battle over for 2.5 hours of screen time."
"Harrison Ford’s final Indiana Jones is a lackluster, emotional conclusion to the campy, adventure franchise that it might be better to skip the film and just go on the ride in Anaheim to relive the magic of the Indiana Jones films."
"Longtime fans should find an adequate conclusion for this 70-year-old hero. And maybe given how ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" turned out, that in itself is the real accomplishment."
"It almost feels wrong to see Indy in high-definition like this. Dial of Destiny lacks the warmth of film, the spirit of adventure, and the twinkle in Indy’s eye."
The frustrating aspect of Dial of Destiny lies in how it scratches at the surface of its predecessors’ magic but never breaks through to the core. 
"James Mangold explores the history of one of the most beloved characters in cinema in such a beautiful way. This explores why Indy stays in the past & is enamored with history, as he’s reluctant of his future after losing his zeal. "
"Watching Ford flashing his crooked smile again, plus his bantering with Waller-Bridge, is almost enough to keep this new instalment whirring.
"
"While the action scenes may not be as groundbreaking as before, and the thrill of treasure hunting may not be as strong, we see Indiana Jones from a fresh perspective – a man lost in time."
"A good, escapist blockbuster. It's what you want."
An affectionate and mostly appropriate return to all the things we love about Indiana Jones.
"It was fun to see Indiana Jones one last time, but there are some problems in this film: too many repetitive chase scenes, some characters not well-drawn, and the third act is weird and wild and just doesn't quite work. "
This film looks and films like it could have been shot in the 1980s and should be enjoyed by those who fell in love with the original films.
"Harrison Ford's still got it and will always have it. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is full of nostalgia, fun and adventure."
"It’s a memorable, legacy-celebrating conclusion that effectively passes the torch. "
"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is everything I wanted. Entertaining, Beautiful, fulfilling, Weird, & Emotional (I cried!) Mangold delivers an Classic Blockbuster that explores Regret, Time, & Our Legacies. "
The film gains momentum in the second half and then all hands on deck and away we go.
"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is not without flaws, but it’s also a journey worth taking: if you’re a fan of the franchise, you won’t be disappointed."
"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"" ... is the trippiest and most rollicking combination of reminiscence and big-screen adventure you’ll see this summer."
"You could fault the new cast members, an insufferable Waller-Bridge in particular. But no. The bulk of the blame falls squarely on James Mangold, the filmmaker who was brave, or foolhardy, enough to take the reins from Spielberg. "
"It’s different from the other films, but that’s to be expected for its age, and it offers a fun dose of adventure and Nazi punching."
Sigh deeply and move on.
There are only hints of the old good salad but lots of mediocre dressing on this plate.
"Director James Mangold hits all the classic Indy beats -- globe-trotting, banter, double-crosses, zany artefacts."
"Harrison Ford’s swan song as the titular character isn’t special, in fact it’s quite a tame escapade and in comparison to the other four (yes, the other FOUR), “Dial of Destiny” is a surprising bore.
"
"Here’s the thing. With James Mangold at the helm, I expected more out of this fifth round with a character who hasn’t looked great since he prowled around the desert with his dad. Ford looks at ease, but the story does not. "
"With an ending that leaves the Indiana Jones character in a satisfying bookend for the franchise, hopefully The Dial of Destiny is the final Indy film. Like Roger Murtaugh in Lethal Weapon, Harrison Ford is literally too old for this sh*t."
This Indiana Jones movie has what you know and love about the Indiana Jones franchise.
"Poorly written, directed, and executed; a disappointment for everyone involved."
"While the franchise might not be ending on a high note, that doesn't make the film entirely bad.  It's great to see Ford in the fedora again, and he carries more emotional weight in this film than ever before."
"Fortunately, there is also a lot of action surrounding the overcomplicated, inconsistent story. The action, like the plot itself, is not believable, but it is entertaining, nonetheless, featuring daring stunts, good effects, and big scale battle scenes."
"When Ford is a) given the right material and b) challenged by the right director/actors, you remember that he’s something more important than a film icon. He’s a damn good actor."
"From Indy giving lectures in the present to its final act, the movie is a jumble of riddles worthy of an escape room. An escape room with your grandpa that lacks... the charisma of the original trilogy. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Indiana Jones gets to punch Nazis again. Some movie joys are timeless — even if, unfortunately, they’re also timely."
"You can tell Steven Spielberg didn’t direct “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.” It has all the adventure of the previous outings, but lacks the humor and sheen Spielberg lavished on his rough-and-tumble hero."
"The original trilogy stands on its own and Crystal Skull was crushingly disappointing. Dial of Destiny is really good, though not great. Unlike Crystal Skull, it's a fitting coda for Indiana Jones that leaves you on the right note for the character. "
"As someone who felt the updated phrase for Jumping the Shark should have been LaBeoufing the Monkeys rather than Nuking the Fridge, I couldn’t help but wince at the late-inning turn of events in a movie without many low points ... or high points, either."
a warmhearted sendoff for the globe-trotting archaeologist that puts star Harrison Ford—at eighty—back in the saddle for one more adventure.
The movie is full of action but it is all over the top and the spaces in between seem to drag. Now the way you would want this franchise to end.
Firmly in the top four Indiana Jones movies.
"Harrison Ford is better than ever in his iconic role as Indiana Jones, it's entertaining, silly, and outrageous exactly what you should expect from this classic movie series. "
"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is faithful to the original story while retaining the zest of the action-adventure serials of the first half of the 20th century that inspired the modern masterpiece of inspired, breathless fun."
"This is a good reminder of why we love going to see big popcorn movies, even when they're not perfect."
"Watching the film—and considering it within the context of the four-decade-spanning franchise—I also wonder if a lasting legacy of Indiana Jones is as a chronicle of disenchantment and faith’s gradual erosion in a secular, technological age."
"Dial poses the same question for its hero that it does for its audience: Does the world still need Indiana Jones? Fortunately for both, the answer is yes."
"This last Indy plays its nostalgia perfectly, checking all the boxes and ending the series aptly. This is what summer viewing used to be and should be."
"While it lacks the magic of the original trilogy, Harrison Ford’s emotional connection to Jones is evident, as he delivers a fantastic performance. This journey gets too silly at times, but there are plenty of moments that work."
"We’re there to see Harrison Ford, with hat and whip, dazzle us with his action scenes and pure star power, and that is more valuable than an ancient treasure."
"Since much of this new movie deliberately references the earlier installments, my wonderment remains dimmed. Still, retro-ness has its appeal, and Dial of Destiny is nothing if not thumpingly old-school."
"What is Dial of Destiny if not an ill-fitting coda to a series that has, for some segment of the Raiders audience with each release, had most of its luster polished off?"
"The Indiana Jones saga gives its iconic character a fifth adventure that moviegoers didn’t ask for, but that longtime fans should appreciate."
"Here is Indy – still thriving, still globe-trotting, still getting into fist fights with rotten Nazis. Is that a bad thing? Absolutely not."
"Despite its flaws, it deserves recognition for its commitment to delivering an adventure of a lifetime."
"As the plot veers into the sci-fi realm that was nearly 100 percent responsible for the downfall of its predecessor, it becomes clear that time is certainly the villain, and even AI can't bring us back our old Doctah Jones."
There’s not much here that’s overtly disappointing; it just never hits the giddy heights of the Spielberg films.
The whole opening of the film... is just a constant stream of sour notes.
"While the crack of Indy’s whip and the moment Ford dons his famous brown fedora may get those feel-good endorphins flowing, it also makes in painfully obvious that a movie can only coast so far on nostalgia."
"Frustrating, underwhelming, and, ultimately, meaningless."
"...allows Indy to nobly, creakily hang up his hat and whip, leaving the rest of us in an increasingly exhausted multiverse of capes and cowls."
It's not the final movie the character of Indiana Jones deserves. The film works as a fun theme park ride.
"The film’s biggest flaw is that it is too long and drawn out. At 154 minutes, Dial of Destiny outlasts Raiders by more than half an hour – and the audience is going to feel every second of it."
Manages to entertainingly encompass every surface-level tenet of an Indiana Jones movie without finding the soul.
"Even if it doesn´t live up to the original trilogy (how could it?), this film certainly presents itself as a much more worthy farewell to one of the most iconic characters that Cinema has created than the last one. [Full review in Portuguese]"
"The conclusion of “Dial” is bittersweet, and if you were to say it’s a bit too neat, I wouldn’t argue. Yet, it’s the way it should end, and is not without its irony. "
"Mangold, who shares screenplay credit with three other writers, gets the emotional tenor right, delivering a consistently pleasurable and intermittently stirring farewell to one of cinema’s most durable heroes. "
It's a good send-off to the legend of Indiana Jones and will make you go back to the original trilogy again.
... The experience of watching Dial of Destiny is best appreciated in relation to Indy: as a character study of a hero whose triumphs and flaws—and how they affect the people closest to him—are laid bare. 
Forgivable on all fronts... exaggerated and disproportionate but tremendously fun and full of heart and charisma. [Full review in Spanish]
"Waller-Bridge steps into the Indy universe like someone born to its whisky-sour blend of the mercenary, the knowing and the wise-cracking. "
"While some might enjoy the nostalgia the movie taps into, but Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is too dull and long for me."
"More than his returns as Han Solo or Rick Deckard, Dial of Destiny lets Ford go to work as a leading man."
Dial of Destiny feels like revisiting a favorite place from a distant memory.
"There was a moment in the 9th century when a bunch of Italians dug up a dead pope and put him on trial. That’s what Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny feels like, a cadaver being propped up and shouted at for two and a half hours."
"Dial of Destiny is not perfect. In fact, it’s a rather flawed movie, and the flaws are extremely noticeable. But it is also very entertaining, exciting, well-acted, traditional at the right places and surprising in the best way."
A worthy successor to Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Ford’s charisma is firing on all cylinders. Indy may complain of “crumbling vertebrae” but the veteran actor more or less carries this $300m blockbuster on his own.
"“Indian Jones and the Dial of Destiny”...pacing, the run time, and overall story prevents any potential rewatch, and it pains me to say this but maybe this gem of a franchise should be left alone or better yet, placed in a museum."
"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" won't be the most memorable of the five films, and the runtime could be about 40 minutes shorter, however, it's got exciting action sequences, 
classic Indiana Jones humor, and makes for a fun theatrical experience."
I was especially taken by the performance of Greta Lee and the supporting work of John Magaro.
"It has the singularity of discussing lack of communication, nostalgia and past love in times of urban alienation, but the characters remain in overly sanitized situations that, little by little, dissolve the layer of intimacy.  [Full review in Spanish]"
"The entire film is punctuated by memorable sequences that function as warnings, as signs or, better yet, as clocks. [Full review in Spanish]"
"With Past Lives, writer and director Song delivers a beautiful and impeccable film where everything is perfectly measured. [Full review in Spanish]"
"In Song's film, delicacy, sensitivity and empathy towards her characters reign. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Past Lives does not contribute much more to love, cinema and spirituality than what a luxurious Sunday article in an elegant magazine offers to sophistication."
"With such a simple plot, full of silences, looks, and small gestures... in her debut, playwright Celine Song composes a story that speaks of the great evils and good of today, of identity, of frustration. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A certainly a well-acted, well directed movie that shows that Celine Song can handle emotion (even sentimentality if you prefer) quite well, in a style that could as well dictate how romantic movies proceed from now on. 

"
"It is subtle, not heavy-handed. It is low-key, without gigantic emotional fireworks. There is real emotion, which finally is revealed, but it is just under the surface most of the time. This is a very well-written and acted film."
"This all sounds rather cryptic, and the film is mysterious. It is also lucid and precise, intimately devoted to its strange lyrical sorrow. It’s as if we are watching feelings in slow motion."
"An elegant and unexpectedly mesmerizing character piece that speaks profoundly to the concept of love in the modern age while using an intelligent and ambitious, but still very relatable woman to do so."
"Taking her time to develop characters and relationships, Song deftly brings the audience deep into the narrative until we are fully invested in the eventual outcome."
"Ultimately, we are all living the same lives, the same experiences, the same feelings. The film exploits the fact that coincidences don't exist and expands the potential of the eternal human question, ""what if?"". Masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The images and the characters’ spatial relationships within them become such a part of the story that, in the final act, simple moments like an awkward silence at a bar or waiting for an Uber transmit tremendous power."
"Subtle and understated, if occasionally mundane, romantic drama, that reflects our complicated lives in a universal story about the life choices, and sweeps you away in its final climactic moments"
"Past Lives is based above all on two long scenes in which the characters talk, and while they do so, they evoke the wounds of time's passage. [Full review in Spanish]"
"This is, possibly, the film that has shaken me the most in the last decade, and it does so not with exaggerated moments of screams and drama, but with the perfect words to rock you into its small cosmos... [Full review in Spanish]"
"Its greatness doesn't so much immediately grab you by the throat but worms its way into your affections more and more with each passing scene, building and building until it becomes impossible to deny in its note-perfect final act."
"Past Lives is notable for what it leaves out. It is a drama of accommodation, a minimalist romance in which the spectre of a grand passion is held tantalisingly at bay."
"A sublime, aching meditation on memory and time, practical love and idealistic romance, and all the complex contradictions that exist in between."
"This gorgeous, life-affirming feature is one of the best I’ve seen this year."
"Past Lives is Song’s first movie, but it feels more like her ninth — it’s wonderfully assured."
Past Lives could battle Oppenheimer at the Oscars. It’s just as explosive.
"Past Lives may be a weepie, but it’s a hyper-sophisticated one."
"Plaudits to the principal cast, who do a miraculous job of portraying inner conflict and ecstasy with the merest tilt of a head, or subtle shift of a shoulder."
"A quietly devastating drama, Past Lives might be one of the early contenders for next year’s Oscars, and is certainly one of the best films you’ll see all year. Watch it before the awards season chatter begins."
Song finds the political in the personal and avoids seeming indulgent or niche. 
The film’s great magic is the way it captures the beauty of lonely cities with a camera that seems to caress their geography.
"There’s a certain tragedy at the heart of this story that no amount of goodwill can soothe: sometimes you don’t get over traumas, you just learn to live with them. But Past Lives, a thoroughly grown-up film, is able to accommodate this inconvenient truth."
"Aesthetically, too, the film is gorgeous -- like something you want to reach out and touch."
"If you are looking for some grown up romance, don’t let Past Lives get away."
It’s barely believable that this is Song’s very first feature. Her film is simply sublime from start to finish.
"It is highly recommended as a touching and always subtle film about old memories, old friendships and contemporary realities."
The performances are impossibly strong and awards-season ready. Anything other than a best actress Oscar nomination for Lee will be criminal. 
It is a film that embraces blended nationalities while acknowledging the pull of one’s earliest home. One leaves aware of unavoidable open-endedness but sated by a work that has achieved all its lofty ambitions.
"Past Lives isn’t quite the woozy, lovelorn drama that its trailers have sold... But it is an eloquent attempt to understand how our memories can end up turning other people into projection screens for our own, confused desires."
"Past Lives is breathtaking, leaving you speechless in the most wonderful way."
"A little movie with the biggest of hearts, Past Lives heralds the arrival of playwright turned director Céline Song as a filmmaker with the brightest of futures. It's the most charming of debuts, and if you miss it, your screen life will be the poorer."
"There is always a forward momentum to the film even when nothing much seems to be happening. All the scenario's emotional complexity, though, is articulated by the actors’ expressions. "
"That it’s exquisitely affecting and made with great precision and care is enough for now. No need to make a song and dance about it. Indeed, as Past Lives so deftly shows, you can have an excellent drama without any of the drama."
"I've never quite seen a love story or a friendship bond told on screen like Past Lives, I was enthralled  with the film, easily one of the best of the year. "
It’s a must-see.
"Past Lives is not only a breath-taking debut by Celine Song, it is a herald to an astounding voice in cinema."
"Past Lives is naggingly unsatisfying: the characters are not fully realised, and nor is their story. The film anticipates an impact it doesn’t earn."
"A transcendent debut for South Korean-Canadian filmmaker Celine Song, this romantic drama is a masterclass in slow, simmering storytelling. It will stay with you, maybe even into your next life."
Celine Song’s directorial debut is a beautiful story of friendship & contemplation about the choices we make in life. It is powerfully relatable and the film shows us that it’s okay to be sad about the road not taken without having regrets.
"In Past Lives, director Celine Song twists the knife on the all-too-familiar romantic woes that Asian immigrants like myself endure: the slow yet gut-wrenching impact of long-distance relationships and our complex relationship with fate."
A tender and mesmerising romance with an absolutely sensational lead performance from Lee.
"It is a movie that carries the weight of years upon its shoulders, of ineffable longing and the possibility of cosmic alignment, but it does so with a cinematic spring in its step."
"The film's directness, its relative storytelling simplicity, is also its asset. Past Lives unravels at a rhythm that weaves a slow-burning spell, one that allows an audience the space to project their own experience onto the screen."
"The masterstroke of Song’s screenplay is that, despite its emotional directness, there is still ample room to reinterpret character dynamics up to and including the devastating final moments."
The bittersweet reconnecting of childhood soulmates wraps an unrealised love story in unanswerable questions.
"One of the best written screenplays for a long, long time. It has a Woody Allen feel to it that just makes it a masterpiece."
"It’s quite the remarkable first film for Song, who brings a tender, elegant economy to her storytelling that doesn’t quite prepare you for how much it’ll wipe you out at the closing stretch. This one aches really good, folks. I can’t shake it."
"Like few others, Past Lives shows the cultural and emotional dichotomy of those of us who have left our countries of origin and never completely detach ourselves from them, no matter how many years go by... [Full review in Spanish]"
"For this is as much a story of her [Nora] wrestling with the importance of her Korean heritage, as it is any romantic notions of fate, destiny or, as the Koreans call it, in-yun. "
"A small, sweet but ultimately soulful film, a triumph for Celine Song and a beautifully unwrapped gift for audiences."
"… starts slow but then ramps up into an absolute stunner of a romantic drama, populated by fleshed-out and endlessly likeable characters who explore deeply relatable aspects of loves and lives that could have been."
"Every shot is well-considered, every line of dialogue neatly parsed, each performance exquisitely choreographed to convey a thoroughly conceived idea in a naturalistic style. It’s a lovely, lovely film, and one of the year’s best."
"A love story that will linger on your mind for a long, long to come."
"This delicate and eloquent meditation on destiny and choice is an emotional experience, beautifully played."
"This is the real deal. If you’ve an interest in five-star contemporary cinema, you miss this at your peril."
"This is a film that understands the dopamine rush of digital connection, but also the way it can be used to prolong the blissed-out potential of a relationship by repeatedly deferring a real-world encounter."
"[F]or all the talk of in-yun, the true past life is the one Nora left behind in Korea[.]"
"Celine Song’s tender, time-spanning romance is an exquisitely judged wonder. A directorial debut of remarkable poise and power."
Past Lives should not be missed.
"It’s fine for a movie not to spell everything out, in fact, it’s preferable. But in Past Lives, Nora’s opacity left me uninvolved at times."
"Past Lives is a film about time, missed opportunities and enduring connections, and Song ably juxtaposes private reflection with romantic longing.  "
"Past Lives is the epitome of contemplative, meditative cinema. "
"Song’s masterful direction and ability to tell a story mostly visually make Past Lives a masterpiece. It’s an eloquent, alluring film about what we leave behind and what we gain from it."
"There’s something transcendent about this story, which captures the bigness of human existence in a way that leaves you in awe, and maybe helps you understand love and loss and life a little better. "
"Culturally specific yet universally resonant, this bittersweet Korean drama is a quietly perceptive and deeply profound look at unspoken relationship bonds."
"Past Lives is a heartrending and deeply felt examination of two souls linked together, that while leaving an enduring impact on each other’s lives, are destined to be apart."
"“Who do you think they are to each other?” The question echoes as the film’s ending returns to the bar where it was initially asked. Perhaps a better question is, what does it mean to know someone?"
"Past Lives is a sonic-visual feast in the service of a deeply moving, revelatory treatise on subtle human truths...it’s easily one of the best films of the year, if not, the best."
Celine Song presents an intimate and delicate three-decade-spanning portrait of the importance people play in our lives that resembles Richard Linklater’s Before trilogy. 
"Past Lives is a emotional experience like no other! Nearly every moment in this film felt real and layered with so many earnest emotions, and it captures that haunting and heartbreaking reality of “what if” PERFECTLY! 

"
Past Lives is schematic but effective; what makes it work are the performances by Greta Lee and Teo Yoo as these star-crossed not-quite lovers’ adolescent and adult incarnations.
Past Lives is the sort of thing that might blow a hole in your chest if you hold regrets about roads not taken.
"A24’s Past Lives is a masterpiece & lives up to everything you’ve heard about it already. Truly a romance for the ages that will break your heart, bring it back together, & then touch your soul. "
"Past Lives is quietly powerful – an understated examination of longing, connection, and unconsummated love."
"The tug of Past Lives is situated in the many moments that come together to shape the film into a meaningful whole about love—lost and found, abandoned and claimed."
"It celebrates the people who leave an indelible mark, regardless of time and distance. What's truly astonishing is how a film this levelheaded can still break your heart into a million tiny pieces."
"Whether you find Past Lives mesmerizing or not, its portrait of relationships rings true -- and could inspire bouts of soul searching."
Nary a dishonest note to be found in this mesmerizing film.
"An absolutely beautiful film, that never collapses into cliche. "
"As Nora, Greta Lee, gives a complex, nuanced performance that understates and fully reveals the depth of her emotions."
Past Lives is one of those rare films that charms audiences with its subtle beauty but wins them over with its immense intelligence and heart.
"""[Celine] Song knows that sometimes to preserve the purity of an eternal love story is to leave it incomplete. After all, believers in romance will often tell you, there’s always a next life."""
Past Lives has an autobiographical touch and offers a memorable cinematic experience well worth having.
"Past Lives is an emotional powerhouse. It's a romance that’s not meant to be, and a film built on the immigrant experience and the power of empathy and honesty in difficult situations.

"
"A bitingly poignant film about heartache, time, longing, childhood friendship and finding closure. "
"PAST LIVES is sexy and funny and tender along its seemingly familiar path, but it never ignores the mundane truth that destiny, more often than not, keeps people apart. Reality isn't a fairy tale."
"It is an embrace of every hitch and hiccup, every misstep and missed opportunity that led you to be who you are. It is a dirge, an elegy for who others saw you to be but who you never were. It is an innocent idea, a dangerous daydream, a painful pleasure."
"The MVP here is John Magaro, who delivers a quietly devastating performance as Nora’s husband, Arthur."
"It is an honest introspection that explores gut-wrenching concepts of regret and destiny, asking us to ponder the consequences of choices."
"Bookended by two departures, Celine Song’s delicate debut Past Lives, in which a woman finds herself torn between two men, is less about the longing for someone you moved away from and more about the version of yourself that you left behind with them."
"Song juggles so many tricky and often conflicting emotions, then deftly wraps them in a delicate but devastating package. It's a dreamy, melancholy, and altogether remarkable debut."
"Practical, logical, and infinitely moving in its humanity. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It’s not about “taking the road less travelled” as Frost would tell with a sigh, but the road not taken that keeps the traveller thinking what could have been. "
The film simply has an attractive charm about it that pulls you in and keeps you interested. 
"Richard Curtis’ Love Actually claims the prize of being the “ultimate romantic comedy” not through daring or originality, but by covering every cliché imaginable offered by the genre, and doing so with style."
"...while Curtis clearly connects more with some stories than others, the best bits are genuinely classics..."
"The work is lopsided and misshapen, not like life, but a poor, contrived, somewhat disoriented impression of life."
"A load of sickeningly twee nonsense inflated, bizarrely, into some kind of totemic Christmas film that only humbugs suggest might not just be rubbish."
It's almost a shock to see such a well constructed and beautifully acted scene (Emma Thompson opening her present) amid the rest of this film's more mainstream machinations.
A collection of touching sketches that are frequently sentimental yet thoroughly grand.
It's a tremendous romantic comedy that far outshines most American comedies.
"Curtis pulls off a spectacular feat of screenwriting, expertly defining 16 principal characters and their relationships, providing each one with a beginning, middle, and end, and making us care about what happens to all of them."
There's so much right and yummy about this multi-tiered plum cake of a romantic comedy.
"The film exhibits a real soft spot for sexual predators, while also promoting the notion that Christmas is the perfect time to publicly dump your love on the near-stranger you're tenderly stalking."
"Now, though, Curtis, England's most successful comic screenwriter, has shown that when it comes to Hollywood pap, the English can teach Hollywood a treacly trick or two."
This plum pudding of a romantic comedy is rich with delicious moments.
Love Actually isn't in love with anyone except itself: it's like watching a practised lounge lizard go through his repertoire.
"Forget about stiff upper lips. Though very British, this irresistible ensemble comedy will easily coax full-sized grins of enjoyment from viewers."
"If you feel yourself glowing after Love Actually, you might be suffering from sugar shock."
"Out of the cacophony of other, newly minted love affairs that promise eternal love forever and ever, theirs stand out like a winter fern among hothouse roses, adding a much-needed zest to the bouquet."
Love Actually provides enough happy endings to make the audience forget that romance and Christmas miracles don't always work out.
"The tagline for Love Actually is ""The Ultimate Romantic Comedy."" Perhaps. But not in the sense the producers intended."
[T]here's more authentic sentiment in a Hallmark card than in the entire movie.
"It is not only the best romantic comedy in quite a long time, it is every romantic comedy in quite a long time, baked into a melange and made gargantuan. I left smiling like a huge imbecile."
"A polished, fluid production with impeccable technical credits and a winning soundtrack, Love Actually is the very definition of entertainment and is guaranteed to bring joy to the world this Christmas."
"As far as frothy, feelgood stuff goes, Love Actually works on most levels."
"[E]ven the best eggnogs can turn sour, and the mistaken addition of paprika in place of nutmeg can transform what should be a treat into something see."
"There is enough love to go around, but I am not sure this movie does a good job of spreading it."
"Sit back, and gawp at Ideal Britain. Revel in the tipsy plot. And enjoy a film full of adult whimsy and adolescent whingeing."
"A trim here, a tuck there, a couple of extraneous characters being shown the cutting-room floor and ""Love Actually"" might actually have emerged as a genuine, warmhearted holiday classic."
"That could have been a fascinating theme, but Mr. Curtis's film has no attitude about it other than blind approval."
The resulting film really is disheartening. [Full Review in Spanish]
Some of the stories this film tells really hook you in. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Does get very, very mushy at times, but the overall excellence of a stellar ensemble (Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson and Laura Linney) more than compensates."
"Love Actually is alternately beguiling and bloated, witty and warmed over, smart and pandering. The majority is likely to swoon."
"As I've said, it's not entirely rinsed free of schmalz but 14 years on, it still works. Happy Christmas."
"Aside from all the hearts and flowers, though, it's Bill Nighy's uproarious turn as an over-the-hill rocker promoting a novelty record that really delivers the laughs."
Seldom have we seen such an extensive ensemble of talent in the movies yanked through the material like lambs on their way to a slaughter.
"Love? Actually, no. More like disappointment, and, at times, hatred."
"A long running time, too many characters and too much whimsy and corn make this romantic romp more of a slog than a soufflé."
Romantic and entertaining -- for older teens.
"Bombastic audience-hooting moments aside, Curtis has written his most accomplished film, finding the energy to direct the hell out of it as well. And it's even gloriously R-rated to boot."
"Despite it's naivety, this is one of the most beautiful and heart warming movies to come around in years..."
"Loads of fun as long as your expectations aren't overly raised by the hype, the cast and the taglines."
"Transfixed by the taboos of the...British class system, Curtis seems to think that nothing could be more erotic than the subordinate who fetches tea or dusts the crockery."
For the cuddlers out there who like things a little too light and fluffy.
Disconcertingly lubricious.
"This is cloying, deceitful, and more or less irresistible."
"Without ever sounding a false note, this endearing ensemble holiday flick manages to be nuttier than Notting Hill, more satisfying than Bridget Jones' Diary, and even more intricate than Four Weddings and a Funeral."
It's a perfectly respectable debut for Curtis.
Plenty of entertainment in this well acted ensemble comedy that Robert Altman could easily have put his name on.
"This is an embarrassment, an overdrawn rom-com gone very wrong."
The film lives up to its hype.
"Packed with plenty of laughs and even a few tearjerker moments, Love Actually is not only a great movie for Christmas time, but just about any time of the year."
"Curtis has created a joyful, entertaining date movie that'll leave you with a smile on your face and an almost irresistible urge to hug somebody."
This is definitely a case of a writer-turned-director that is too in love with his own script to make hard choices about what to keep and what to cut.
Funny? Maybe. Not to me.
"Curtis has lost none of his touch, though the ending is somewhat muddled and 135 minutes is very long, even for a good romantic comedy."
A highly engineered puffball.
"A charming little film that, unfortunately, gets carried away with itself and never quite makes the grade."
It's tart and amusing but carries a slightly cloying aftertaste.
"My problem is an acute allergy to repitition. Love, Actually and other champions of the romantic-comedy flyweight division make me break out in hives."
Ten romantic comedies rolled into one.
"In the end the film is just as winsome and sugary as its facile message: ""love, actually, is all around."""
"It wants to swirl round the world and find love in every cranny, but it doesn't have the effortless rush of energy that it would need to make the masses of plot come together."
One character goes on about the 'total agony' of being in love. That's nothing compared to the agony of watching these people in the agonies of love.
"While the movie is occasionally charming, the soufflé falls flat in the end ..."
"Impressive, if self-indulgent directing debut."
"Upon first viewing, it is something of a guilty pleasure. Upon second viewing, it is simply a pleasure."
This kind of comedy has just hit the wall.
There's simply too much here to digest.
"Screenwriter Richard Curtis tries to direct, puts too many eggs in his basket, and winds up with a very runny omelette."
Curtis repeats and reiterates these themes to the point that it's just as redundant as saying that someone repeats and reiterates in the same statement.
"'Encantadora, romántica y mágica, es una de esa cintas que cualquiera que aún crea en la bondad humana y en lo hermoso de las relaciones personales va a disfrutar como nadie'"
"Love Actually is cheerful and undeniably romantic and, despite its flaws, you'd be hard-pressed to sit through the credits without smiling."
Sitting through 128 minutes of this much aggressive charm and wit is like being mugged in slow motion by beautiful people from the pages of Vanity Fair.
"All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie until, in the end, it went somewhat bonkers with what amounted to a communal love fest on Christmas Eve."
Whatever the actors are given to do they make so delightful -- or so delightfully moving -- that Love Actually wins out over its wobbles.
The year's busiest and most relentlessly shameless comedy. It's also among the year's funniest and most disarming.
"Jamais deixa de ser envolvente, já que Curtis, um escritor experiente, é hábil na construção das histórias, que são recheadas com seu humor tipicamente britânico."
It tries to cover all aspects of love and succeeds far better than you would expect it to.
"There's good acting in Love Actually, but director Richard Curtis threatens to take the cool out of London."
Richard Curtis is so earnest ... that what otherwise might seem overly sentimental and cloying comes across as genuinely touching
"Peppered with so many moments of raw, affecting honesty that it's intensely difficult to dislike -- and tempting to forgive Richard Curtis for not finishing what he starts,"
"For all my reservations about Love Actually, I found it amusing and sweet."
"Classy, so long as you approach it without thought, basic narrative understanding, and resistance to unearned sentiment."
You'll laugh! You'll cry! And you'll go home feeling ever so slightly used...
'Why make one good romantic comedy when you can make nine bad ones?'
I'll take an overly sentimental movie over a sardonic one any day - particularly around the holidays. Now if I only Santa would tuck Hugh under my Christmas tree.
"This movie contains everything except Bridget Jones, actually."
"[Curtis'] sheer glee is infectious. He's playing us like fiddles, we know he's playing us like fiddles, and he knows that we know, and everyone loves it."
"When a situation becomes intriguing, writer-director Curtis develops ADD and shifts focus. Fortunately, the cast and Curtis' eye for absurdly comic situations wins out."
"Like the holiday season itself, the movie overwhelms you, but in an agreeable way."
"Go, you weapy-eyed romantics. It's too long but mostly fun, actually."
"Directorial debut of Brit-com master Richard Curtis is a big, bright ensemble tale with many delights -- and absolutely no surprises."
"An utterly charming, classy and uproarious work of romantic hopefulness."
"Love, Actually"" is a bit sluggish at times, the film's good nature and wit grows on you."
"Richard Curtis has, with this 4th Working Title chick flick, possibly ruined it for all men by just getting what women want in an onscreen man, - we're not complaining."
"Warm, bittersweet and hilarious, this is lovely, actually. Prepare to be smitten."
"The hollowness of the stories that lie behind each of these shameless heart-grabbers, laugh-getters and tear-jerkers becomes quickly apparent."
There were times watching this movie when I felt I was being force-fed 30 pounds of crème brûlée.
... a terrific film.
"Runs long and gets silly at times, but it is not embarrassed to be a simple, happy film that affirms life and love."
"Sacrilegious to the original and apparently the first of a proposed trilogy, it will be hard to keep faith beyond this lacklustre entry. "
"The Exorcist: Believer asks us not to put our faith in any specific dogma but rather in people, in love, and in the fact that your neighbor is experiencing pain, and no matter what you believe, THAT is real. "
"The outcome is a qualified success – a horror feature that tries to say something profound about good and evil, love and faith, but ultimately creeps around the edges of these big topics."
"Believer is a poorly edited-together combination of ideas that had potential. The film starts out as a haunting mystery, but it slowly morphs into an empty and unnecessary sequel."
This occasionally jump-scary homage fails to break any new ground.
"There are moments in this borderline incoherent mess of a movie in which fans may be convinced that its sole purpose is to try making the original follow-up, 1977’s legendarily godawful Exorcist II: The Heretic, look positively genius by comparison."
"Congrats to the filmmaking team, I guess: they might have made some utter, contemptible trash, but at least it's not lazy trash."
They need to stop making Exorcist movies. We don't need any more!
"This was completely unnecessary. The rules were never clear and the various character actions, particularly the lead's, made no sense. "
This is not a good movie and it's even more offensive because the cast is stacked. Not sure how this misfire happened but really hoping we don't get a sequel to this...
"As he did with 'Halloween' (2018), director David Gordon Green pays homage to a 1970s classic with just enough new touches to bring it up to date. 'The Exorcist: Believer' may be unnecessary, but it's mostly entertaining. "
"The film has good performances, some interesting themes - especially for people of faith - and even a relatively credible drama. Where it fails, unfortunately, is in terms of originality, and more importantly, HORROR. Full review in Spanish."
"The Exorcist is now 50 years old, and luring Burstyn back isn’t enough to render this retread fresh."
An okay movie that I think will become more appreciated over the years as it isn’t the worst that this series has delivered fans. 
"Despite haunting makeup, practical/visual effects, and editing, the screenwriters fail to take creative risks that would elevate the story."
The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world to keep making bad Exorcist sequels.
"Considering Green's lousy track record with horror properties, perhaps it’s time to perform an exorcism on his career in hopes of salvaging some semblance of a bright future."
...a half-baked sequel that squanders its massive potential.
"50 years after Friedkin's masterpiece, the most basic and accessible triumph of this sequel by David Gordon Green is that it isn't a total disaster. [Full review in Spanish]"
"If it has ""Exorcist"" in the title then  it had better be scary. This wasn't."
The Exorcist: Believer is a plain film in both its intention and its execution. Green's attempt to connect this mediocre exorcism film with the 1973 horror classic is a miserable farce.
"You need more than head-twisting, jumpcuts, and platitudes about faith to make for a compelling paranormal horror in the same vein as The Exorcist; Believer isn’t even in the same country."
"Any resemblance between “The Exorcist” and “The Exorcist: Believer” is purely intentional.

"
David Gordon Green and Co continue to bog down beloved horror franchises with poor story-telling and bloated casts of characters that only further water down the underwhelming arcs of Green’s main characters.
"Group-think and nostalgia worked against The Exorcist: Believer, with many already wanting to dislike it. Yet, the movie delivers genuine terror, an expansion on possession lore, and a story with a lot of heart. "
"A rock solid first half -- character-driven, strong build of dread, and successful at conveying the sheer terror of watching a loved one, especially a child, slip away & feeling helpless in the fight to get them back. But then it becomes a forced sequel."
"More of a shrug than an outright abomination, The Exorcist: Believer wastes so much potential, which almost makes it worse than even the franchise's worst entries. At least they tried to do something different. "
This is a lazy cash-grab that relies too much on goodwill from its 50 year old predecessor and has way too many characters. Most annoying is how Believer doesn't have anything new to say about religion; it certainly isn't transgressive or audacious.
The most grievous sin committed by The Exorcist: Believer is how rank dull it all is. 
Let the power of the critic compel you to skip this movie.
There's no point in bringing these classics back from the dead when they are already startlingly alive.
I don't know how you could not just laugh at this film. Truly one of the worst films of the year.
"50 years removed and filmmakers still think the original worked because of pea soup, head-twisting and vulgarities instead of the terrifying internal struggle of believing in the forces for good and evil. David Gordon Green's is the worst of the lot."
" Believer won’t satisfy your need to scream. The fright level is low. The movie poster is scarier. The ending was the best, but not necessarily because it was over"
An unholy disaster.
"The Exorcist: Believer, a new legacy-quel to the 1973 horror landmark, is well acted, but so what?.. That’s only a tragedy in the sense that Green has shown us he’s an honest-to-God auteur with something to say. But he isn’t saying much of anything here."
"Offers nothing new to the formula. And if you were worried Believer wouldn’t play the hits during the exorcism, fear not. It’s all there, and fans of the original will know to what we are referring."
About as circumstantial as a used Band-Aid stuck to the floor of a public pool.
"Never mind that it's all but impossible to figure out just what the film is trying to say with the exorcism, but it is so thoroughly devoid of any internal logic or basic storytelling competence that I can't explain what happened even if I wanted to.   "
"The result is something that feels neutered of its power, banking on nostalgia to mask a weak-kneed retread that's never able to justify its own reason for being."
"David Gordon Green’s The Exorcist: Believer fundamentally misunderstands its source material and has nothing of any real substance to say.

"
"The film seems like too much of a rehash of things we’ve seen before. And, despite the obvious effort involved, it still, ultimately, is a bummer.
"
"The film’s latter half lacked substance. The narrative didn’t offer us enough opportunities to resonate with the story or characters, so the emotional impact was diluted when revelations unfolded. "
It got some jump scares and that's fun... but not much else. 
"[Burstyn's] presence anchors this film to the heft of that brand name, and elevates a film that is otherwise comme ci, comme ca."
"Designed as a direct sequel to the 1973 classic, this is merely pointless freak-out horror, technically adept at creating impressive visuals but never coming close to the underlying themes that make the first film so indelible."
There are samples of formulaic movies that don't result in anything good and The Exorcist: Believer is a dramatic example that it could even be worse. [Full review in Spanish]
"It never gets close to recreating the miasmic chill of William Friedkin’s 1973 classic, or generating any fresh frights of its own. "
"However, overall this is a surprisingly class act, with enough devil in the detail to thoroughly enjoy."
"[The Exorcist: Believer] has the same solemnity as the 18-certificate original — and brings back one of its stars, Ellen Burstyn — but the sense of evil isn’t there. "
...  To tackle a prestige project that’s steeped in Christian iconography and biblical allusions by simply defanging it with kindness is beyond pointless.
I award this piece of garbage a Zero out of 5 possible stars. There was a day when the prospect of a David Gordon Green film would have me excited. Now...I get scared for all the wrong reasons with his name on a film. 
"That depiction of a particular kind of horror story is extremely well done, but actually, the film loses its way as the supernatural dimension builds, culminating in an extravagantly overwrought exorcism scene. "
"... The direct references to the landmark that has brought us here seem interesting, but the film results in a pastiche of reflections of the past filtered by the contemporary optics of the industry. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Although an imperfect film with good ideas that are not always well executed, it is appreciated that [Believer] goes for a mix between the suggested and the explicit in which the former wins over the latter... [Full review in Spanish]"
"Odom Jr. shines in his performance as a man who will stop at nothing to keep his daughter safe, in a sequel the slowly builds up towards an explosive conclusion. "
"The same inspirational greeting-card sentimentality about “healing” that induced unkind laughter in Halloween Ends surfaces here, just as awkwardly."
"There’s enough here to make it all hold together, even if it’s starting to fray at the edges by the end. “The Exorcist: Believer” is not a new supernatural horror classic, but it is a solid, spooky time at the movies."
"Because Green has always been a talented director, bits and pieces of “Believer” work effectively before the movie decides serious issues of belief, evil and the widening social divide in America must take a back seat to a screeching sound mix."
Respectful – and suitably scary – continuation of the mythos.
"David Gordon Green's direct sequel to the 1973 classic starts off promising and has genuinely terrifying moments, but towards the end moves into bad sequel territory. "
Not that entertaining.
"The United Colors of Benneton angle is so overplayed, on the way out of the theater a pal said he wished they’d gone all the way and brought in a Hare Krishna to help."
"This is a huge waste of a very talented cast, and another very low low in this franchise. If you were hoping for scares, something to root for, or something at least moderately interesting, this is not the movie for you."
David Gordon Green needs to be stopped.
The power of Christ compels you to not see this direct sequel to “The Exorcist” (1973). 
While the first half is pretty strong it starts to fall off once it becomes a legacy sequel forcing a connection to the original. The film tackles some cool ideas but never fully fleshes them out. 
"It requires a rare ineptitude to take what is famously one of the most terrifying movies ever made, recycle pretty much everything (including Tubular Bells on the score) but neglect to include the scares."
It is very clear that the themes William Peter Blatty established in the original Exorcist is beyond the comprehension of director David Gordon Green. 
"The Exorcist: Believer had a lot of things going for it. They gave the director (David Gordon Green) several balls, and he dropped all of them."
"'The Exorcist: Believer' offers two demonic possessions for the price of one, but less than half the scares of the original."
"Much like David Gordon Green’s recent Halloween trilogy, the filmmaker’s attempt to resurrect The Exorcist franchise with The Exorcist: Believer is wildly ambitious. It is also pretty much guaranteed to be equally polarizing."
"Somehow, the film's all-star makeup crew turns both possessed girls into eerily creepy reminders of Linda Blair's all-time bedeviled victim. Maybe even more scary is how seamlessly 90-year-old Ellen Burstyn returns as heroic mom Chris MacNeil."
"Apparently, the director is already at work on two sequels. My request is simple: please shelve them. There’s nothing in The Exorcist: Believer that makes me want to revisit this world again."
"The first hour of The Exorcist Believer is a decent Exorcist movie (...) And then, the rest of the movie happens and destroys all the goodwill that it had generated in that first half."
Fans of the original film should embrace the fact that Green has entwined the two plots so well but on the other hand the film feels like it runs too long and brings nothing new to the exorcism sub-genre. 
"The Exorcist: Believer preaches more to the converted than to new recruits; the sense of faux religious conviction which was the strongest point of the series is drowned out in a flurry of Halloween-cake make-up, geysers of vomit and easily snapped necks."
"The young actresses impressively sell their possessed characters; dead stares, ominous movements and menacing line delivery to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up – even if the devil’s profanity is a lot tamer this time around. "
They threw out the playbook. The iconic original had one thing not easily achieved- MENACE. It was more important then the head spinning.
"Regardless of its intentions as a reverential follow-up, the film doesn’t possess nearly the same ability to provoke or frighten."
"The Exorcist: Believer does not dazzle, does not leave a mark. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Exorcist: Believer is possible the most cynical and lazy attempt I've seen at cashing in on a beloved movie's legacy. Forcing in a bizarre and wasted cameo and a few mentions of ""Regan"" is all that differentiates this from the dozens of Exorcist ripoffs."
"The Exorcist: Believer fails to install a crisis of faith, which is the key to this universe.  [Full review in Spanish]"
"The Exorcist: Believer possesses none of the thrills, scares, or originality that made The Exorcist such a big deal, spewing the pea soup to the proverbial curb and dialing down on scares that won't convert most viewers to fans."
"Exorcist: Believer is never boring, but by the time it's over it feels a bit hollow. That still puts it behind Exorcist III and the TV series but at least the franchise is back on the right path."
"Green doesn’t quite have the verve or creative ability to pull off the subtlety that made the original Exorcist an enduring classic. However, the ideas he’s exploring here are admirable."
"It’s largely a testament to an almost-50-year-old movie that The Exorcist: Believer delivers so few proper scares, even with an extensive modern-CGI budget and the enthusiastic support of its studio, Universal."
"It tries some interesting things, but murky cinematography and an unfocused plot fails to live up to the better films in the series."
"While we get why Green’s film doesn’t indulge, we would have loved to see more freaky gross moments and backwards crab walking."
I wouldn’t bet against some future boffin declaring this latest episode an underappreciated classic. It meets all the requirements: it’s terrible; many will certainly fail to appreciate it.
"While the elegantly crafted, head-swiveling sequel fails to reach new heights, it delivers on suspense and jump scares, uplifted by returning original cast member Ellen Burstyn, 90!"
"As a film, it’s at best serviceable, stronger in its world-building than in its climactic exorcism and nowhere near as unnerving as the original. "
"A worthy sequel the maintains the thematic validity of its ancestor, but on its own path. [Full review in Spanish]"
"While The Exorcist: Believer is easily the best of David Gordon Green's horror exercises, it still doesn't hold a candle to the original, or to most current horror offerings."
"After 50 years, The Exorcist has been revisited in various formats, and perhaps the most fitting way to celebrate the film's 50th anniversary would be to leave it undisturbed."
"It’s only been two months since William Friedkin passed away, but I fully expect him to rise from the grave and give David Gordon Green a beating for The Exorcist: Believer."
The build-up to the dual exorcism is so terrible it’s almost funny...
"Most notably, it fails to be even remotely scary. While there’s only two attempted jump scares, the main disappointment is the portrayal of the possessions. The title event gets very limited screen time and what is depicted is not noteworthy."
"I’ve pretty much lost faith in the franchise, and I suspect the two planned follow-ups are now in jeopardy. But as my twelve-year-old self was back in 1973, I’ll be planted in a theater seat when The Exorcist: Deceiver comes out in 2025, God willing."
"While Green did a fine job with the overall look and feel of the film and some great jump scares, will this ever touch the original? Of course not. But it does provide some seasonal scares and is fun to see on the big screen with a lively audience."
"Every choice here—every line, every prop, every idea—is at once thoughtful and fun, for a moving meditation on womanhood delivered as a singular cinematic experience."
"Barbie isn't just about the doll. Barbie is an explosion of concepts made into a movie, which will make you change your perspective on life, yes, Barbie is a movie that changes lives, and that's what that's what cinema is for. {Full review in Spanish}

"
"A sassy comedy that raises questions for people of all ages about what it means to frame your life as a quest.
"
"Barbie is feminism 101, but for the global mainstream audience who have been served nothing but depoliticised superheroes for decades, the directness of Barbie's feminism is an essential step for reclaiming the soul of the Hollywood blockbuster.

"
"[Barbie] takes our complicated real-world relationship to Barbie and uses it as a metaphor to interrogate the impossibly high, often contradictory standards women are held to in our male-dominated culture."
To watch Barbie is to feel totally and completely seen. And that's what makes Barbie worthy of the wait. 
"The laughs are plentiful and the set design is eye-popping, but what makes Barbie truly work is its deft tackling of numerous themes."
"Barbie boasts impressive production design, costumes, and a pair of leads up to the task of bringing their respective dolls to life, but sadly comes up a little short when it comes to its screenplay."
"The film’s boldness and, frankly, weirdness, allows Barbie to become a successful sum of its parts. It’s a film that clearly has something to say and doesn’t want audiences to get caught up in the fact that it’s a doll at the center of it."
"One of the best films of the year in cinematographic terms, probably the best comedy that we have seen in a long time, and an extraordinarily entertaining product that promotes the value of searching for a more cohesive society. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Gerwig and Baumbach lure viewers with the promise of squeaky clean pop-culture fun, all while Trojan-horsing a stranger, more complex battle of the sexes."
Barbie is a dazzling new instant classic and unlike anything you’ve seen before. It’s the perfect summer movie and one of the funniest of the year.
"Though presented as a funny comedy about the doll that we all know, in reality, it is a very fine and brave portrait of what it means to be a man and a woman today. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Early-on, ""Barbie” resembles those Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello beach party movies. It's breezily photographed in pop art colors by Rodrigo Prieto. In Barbieland, the houses don’t have walls and everybody seems happy. Mellow whimsy prevails."
"It explores the frailties of masculinity and the post-feminist struggle to escape the matrix of utopian feminism, even though Barbie and Ken's journey of self-discovery sometimes misses the point of fun. [Full review in Spanish]"
It's the rare film that's as intelligent as it is entertaining.
"...[Greta] Gerwig’s pink, plastic epic is infused with its director’s indie spirit and far more cognizant of the toy’s complicated legacy than you might expect."
"The film gets a little lost at times, as if it had too many storylines to play with and won’t let any of them go... But there are many great jokes in the film."
Greta Gerwig has created a coming-of-age feminist self-aware masterpiece in Barbie with a heart of gold that both subverts and matches expectations.
"Barbie isn’t as streamlined as my favorite girl comedies, but it’s more thematically ambitious than many of them too. And I’ll take flawed ambition over plastic perfection any day of the week."
"All is peaceful and idyllic, that is until Stereotypical Barbie inexplicably blurts out a passing thought about death."
"Greta Gerwig's summer blockbuster is well worth watching, but fails to reach the storytelling heights of her previous work."
"This funny, eye-catching film sports pitch-perfect performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, paying tribute to the iconic toy while skewering the patriarchy and feminist window-dressing."
Gerwig didn’t just make a great movie; it’s something that will buckle the knees and tug hard on the heartstrings for generations of viewers. This is the work of a marvelous filmmaker who knows exactly what she is and wants to do.
"Serious and lightweight at the same time, Barbie proves surprisingly successful, much like the doll that inspired."
"Barbie is not a perfect movie, but it is a conversation, and a conversation worth having. For me, Barbie brought the unexpected pleasure of finding shared experiences in our fractured, factious age. "
"While these existential questions are refreshing in a mainstream movie, the real magic is found in how they move toward maturity: through imperfection and mistake."
The story is simple and sweet.
"[Gerwig] and partner Noah Baumbach have penned a very clever script that packs in humour, sadness, satire and a powerful feminist message."
"Barbie, the movie, might make a few missteps as a feminist polemic, but it largely succeeds as a gleefully subversive look at the dehumanizing effects of inequality and how a simple idea can change the world."
Barbie is full of laughs and lots of pink! But the one thing that stood out to me the most were the messages within the movie. While the film was very meta in many ways it brought a lot of  much needed women's rights issues to the forefront!
"In the new film, “Barbie,” Greta Gerwig paints a world where anything is possible, where girls can realize ambitions, dream big and call the shots – not unlike the activity that has swirled around the toy for decades."
Barbie‘s downfall is triggered by a midsection that grows less and less interesting (and more and more grating) as time progresses...
"The film is a wicked satire of all that the Barbie franchise stands for; at the same time, it is never mean spirited. In fact, it’s a celebration. A balancing act for the ages."
"I can’t imagine seeing it a second time, because everything is right there on the surface (except for the Mattel Easter eggs, I guess), easy to grasp and easy enough to enjoy. And that’s it."
"Greta Gerwig, seeking to forge a distinguished persona for Barbie, one that steps beyond the corporate machinations and transnational interests of Mattel, secures a delicate equilibrium that noticeably tips in her favor."
There's a winking sense of humor that I really enjoyed.
"It is in many ways reverential to Barbie, and in other ways subversive. It's kind of amazing that it manages to do both."
"This first live-action Barbie film is not, as some may assume, for kids, but more for the teenagers and adults who have played with the doll in the past "
"This is the only Barbie movie that could have been made, and though colorful that makes it a little bland and a little sad, like staring deeply into a bowl of Lucky Charms. "
"The first forty minutes were hilarious and then it started to taper off a bit, particularly things with America's daughter. The leads did an amazing job and the musical numbers were weird and fun. "
"Kudos to Greta Gerwig for balancing a talented cast with different comedy sensibilities into a cohesive, hilarious and thought provoking film that made me examine my own biases. "
"Greta Gerwig’s pink-plastic jab at the patriarchy is one of the most subversive films of the year, possibly the decade. It's also one of the most philosophically rich."
Barbie is a good time at the movies. The nearly two-hour runtime flies by and is jam-packed with incredible set pieces and endless imagination.
"Gerwig’s pacey direction of her own co-written script delivers 114 minutes of neon-pink absurdity, big musical numbers, genuine belly laughs and sly, self-aware digs at popular culture."
"At its core, Gerwig’s film delivers a surprisingly strong emotional hook in Barbie’s conundrum of being caught between her idyllic plastic life and the ever-changing, complicated real world."
"There are many references that the movie makes to aspects of pop culture, and to discover them all one would need to give it a second look [Full review in Spanish]"
BARBIE is a cinematic phenomenon that pulls off the rarest of feats: using a doll to make a striking commentary about gender politics. Greta Gerwig levels up as a director and writer with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling delivering career best performances.
"It's hard to understand getting angry about a film like Barbie. It's such a joyously bonkers, rip-roaringly hilarious, and yes very pinkly-coloured piece of pure unbridled entertainment. 

"
This Barbie movie might be too candied and flamboyant but is certainly not silly.
"Barbie, while far from perfect, is an unexpectedly delightful breath of fresh and campy air with a reasonably well-delivered feminist message."
"With a final line that's one of the best in the business, Barbie shows it's possible to both deconstruct the ideal and keep the manufacturer onside with a script that is a masterful balancing act, some subtle, smart direction and some terrific actors"
Barbie is a small miracle. [Full review in Portuguese]
Signaling the reach and limitations of a feminist point of view beleaguered by a consumerism that assimilates and trivializes social causes... the film simultaneously mirrors it and questions it blandly. [Full review in Spanish]
"If Barbie were made 15 or even 10 years ago I would have eaten it up like a perfectly toasted waffle with a dollop of cream. Instead, being feministsplained about the patriarchy & gender inequality every 5 minutes soured me to it"
Better than I could have ever expected a Barbie movie to be.
"It’s unfortunate that in a film where she goads her characters to find themselves, director Greta Gerwig's creative voice is flattened out by a corporation’s."
"This is what happens when you don't do a satire correctly. Barbie is what happens when capitalism dictates messages about girlhood, feminism, and gender inequality. "
Gracefully combines the lightness of cotton candy entertainment with the cleverness of a well-crafted plot
"Barbie is Gerwig’s weirdest, funniest and most bonkers film to date. Within the studio system, we should all be very grateful it exists. "
"When I became a father I searched for movies that would show my daughter positive role models, and it was tough going. Barbie makes up for lost time and should warm the hearts of parents and daughters alike."
"...portrays the message that men need women but women, most of the time, only need themselves, but I doubt most will be offended as the harshness is done in a loving and humorous manner that we men are not supposed to understand in the first place."
"In a world where blockbuster films are surrounded by digital landscapes, Barbie’s devotion to practical production is outstanding. "
"It might not land perfectly for every single member of its audience, but at its core, “Barbie” is a movie packed with joy, and a blast of fun at the movies this summer. "
"Barbie performs a great trick: it takes in crowds aching for fantasy and switches the script, telling them that reality and their flawed, beautiful selves is all they have to love."
"Barbie is, at best, half a movie."
"If you don’t like one gag, stick around, another is on the way."
"The Barbie flick struts self-awareness, luring us all in. But humor falters by act three, like an SNL skit past its prime. Fear not, for Ryan Gosling's charismatic portrayal of Ken almost rescues the day... but not quite!"
Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken were superb casting. They both can project a very plastic emotional shell or be internally damaged when needed.
"Race, culture, sexuality and other parts of identity were left in its original packaging lowering the overall impact and highlighting the heavy handed focus on the gender binary."
"It is clever and funny at times. The look of the movie, with its vibrant Barbieland colors, is a wonderful change from the bland way most movies look nowadays."
"Slathered with satire that isn’t sugar-coated, Barbie’s message hits hard."
"The film tries to do too much, but we can’t be anything less than deeply impressed that anyone came up with too many smart, funny, biting things to say in a movie about Barbie, of all things."
"“Barbie” is the perfect brand to tell this story. An unexpected exploration of the value of being a human being, how we shouldn’t be solely defined by our gender and the pros and cons of both matriarchy and patriarchy"
"This film is pink on estrogen! It is a smart, fun and important look at an American Icon. It humorously portrays male figures like Ken as accessories in Barbie Land, but the focus remains on highlighting Barbie's importance rather than vilifying men."
"Barbie has a lot of good qualities. ... The problem is that a little amount of Barbie and Ken goes a long way, and the film eventually comes off as one-note. Barbie could have been a great Saturday Night Live skit.
"
"A fearless feminist manifesto that’s perfectly wrapped in a pretty pink bow, the film is a defiant, thought-provoking, brutally honest exploration of the female experience."
"Margot Robbie stars as Stereotypical Barbie with Ryan Gosling is her Ken, but the film doesn’t live up to the hype."
"Gosling walks away with the film, both through the patriarchy and his hilariously sincere performance. Overall, it’s one hell of an achievement. It’s just not the one we were looking for. "
"The good news is that Barbie is an excellent film and is possibly the cinematic event of the summer. In leading their team, Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig have made a smart and sunny blockbuster with something to say."
"In trying to say too much, the film winds up not saying much at all."
"Greta Gerwig tackles philosophical questions that are more daunting than a film based on a children’s toy can handle. It results in a strange, uneven, but beautiful movie. "
"The film goes beyond an ideological corset, yet it remains faithful to its framework as a comedy about marketing fiction. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Just enjoy the performances by fine actors having a ball in fabulous costumes on outrageous sets. And if you or your little sisters come away with some meaty food for thought, more power to it. It can be many things to many people. That's the glory of it."
Much deeper than its superficial pink packaging. Greta Gerwig cleverly comments on the complex gender dynamics of a popular toy brand that has so many inherent contradictions. Listen closely and you’ll hear the box office shouting: “Closer I am to fine!”
"Barbie is strained and smug without much wit. One should bear in mind that Mattel, with revenue of $42 billion in 2022, partnered with Warner Bros. on the making of the movie. "
"Sadly, Barbie isn’t the brilliant film that many hoped it would be. The cheesy comedy often gets in the way of what could have been a very important storyline and to be honest many will expect more from a Gerwig film."
A high-heeled Trojan horse from which it espouses all matter of feminist nonsense that is eye-rolling at best and sexist at worst.
"Barbie, the doll, not the movie, is made of contradictions and Gerwig has done a mighty fine job of giving those contradictions the sparkliest, shiniest, warmest visual avatar."
Greta Gerwig serves up a frothy confection of fashion and fun coupled with searing social critique of the iconic doll in the movie Barbie.
"With a clever opening sequence and an excellent cast, Barbie manages to overcome cumbersome plotting and feminist pieties to provide a delightful spectacle of funny moments that add up to something pretty good."
"Amid all the pink, there’s plenty of room for a think."
"Through the film’s satirical insights about modern society, the director asks all the right questions."
Barbie was solid -- it was a good time [with a] great message.
'Barbie' actually turns examining the toy’s impact on generations of girls and women into its whole raison d’être.
"For every nod and wink it offers the audience, there is also an urgent call to attention simmering beneath those barbed and razor-sharp quips and puns. "
Is Barbie a goofy romp or a heady subversion of genre?
"The film may skew towards girls but there’s more than enough story, laughs and pratfalls for boys and their dads to embrace."
"Gerwig’s satire and the comedic chops of Robbie and, especially, Gosling fall into perfect rhythm once Barbie and Ken leave the candy-colored comforts of Barbie Land and Ken discovers the patriarchy."
"Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig have created an edgy, existential, empowering comedy-adventure that cleverly exposes our sexist societal shortcomings."
"In Martin Scorcese’s telling of the Osage Indian murders, all the violent contradictions of history unfold in domestic intimacy."
"While Killers of the Flower Moon covers familiar territory for Scorsese, he cedes the floor to the righteous fury of the Osage and other indigenous folks. "
"It features a fascinating fact-based story, some brilliantly filmed set pieces, and a great ensemble cast with some of America’s finest actors."
A largely compelling and engaging cinematic experience
"Killers rises toward genre horror, and the horror comes from the intimacy of the violence being committed against the Osage..."
"Who is Ernest, really, but a much dimmer, more passive Henry Hill?"
"The subject may seem well-worn—a true-life story of a murder spree—but Scorsese elevates it into a meditation on love, guilt, and what it means to be righteous."
"Killers of the Flower Moon is as searing an epic as Martin Scorsese has made in his career, and if we don’t take this ending very seriously, we’re going to lose the medium."
"A killer of historical truth as well. With a seeming connection dropped from the title, 'The Birth Of The FBI' - and the US continuing that not unrelated pseudo-messianic urge, millions in the world slaughtered in that deplorable bid to 'save democracy.'"
"Scorsese’s key interest in this narrative is the criminal machinations of the plot, which is no surprise given his career has almost exclusively been that type of film..Molly is a support character in what should be her story."
"A love story set amidst a series of murders revealing how indigenous people have been victims of the shadow side of American society -- racism and white supremacy.
"
"It's not as flashy as some of Scorsese's other films, with fewer expansive set pieces than we often see, but it has a soulfulness and quiet power that makes it one of his very best."
Killers of the Flower Moon is a strong historical retelling of an abominable series of killings. But it suffers for straddling the line between an American biopic and a Scorsese gangster film.
"Proving his distaste for comic book popcorn movies, director Martin Scorsese delivers significant cinema with his take on Killers of the Flower Moon."
"A masterfully staged fresco darkly hued by cynicism, avidity, and transgression."
"DiCaprio and De Niro carry the film through their impersonations of what they are not, their acting of an act, so to speak: the nice, if rough-edged guy, and the genial businessman, the toast of the town."
"Conspicuously lacking in any of the usual Hollywood glamourisations of the greed that built an Empire, it is also a study in why films should never be too respectful of any topic beyond the duty to their own art form."
"We need films like this that move us to action, that cause us to contemplate our own role in the chain of things, our complacency which could be the evilest actions of all, and what we can do better."
"While other films by the director may surpass it by a very small margin, Killers of the Flower Moon stands as a superb, inquisitive, and surprising film. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Poignant and sobering, KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON dissects America's revolting treatment of the indigenous.

Martin Scorsese’s directing shines but it’s Lily Gladstone who truly steals every moment with an incredible performance."
"By taking the focus away from the victims, [the movie] is no better than a true-crime podcast leaning into the scandalous side of things instead of providing meaningful reflection and insight from the people who experienced such immense, terrible loss."
Ernest can’t draw a line between fact and fiction. He is unable to reconcile his genuine feelings with the part he is expected to play in this genocidal plot.
"At three and a half hours, the film journeys through time in many ways, but for the most part it doesn't drag too much. And while not perfect, there are many things I enjoyed in this undertaking so I'll give it a grade of B."
This film is another testament to the monumental work in front of and behind the camera.
"This film will do some good. If you don’t know the history — which, like every example of racist greed, is now even harder to address in educational contexts — the brazen horror of it all can be overwhelming."
"This film is methodical, emotional, and ultimately one of Scorsese’s more powerful outings. Gladstone steals every single scene. The subtle score is the heartbeat that keeps everything moving fluidly, even with the slower pacing."
"In the world of Scorsese it is impossible to grasp for any sort of earthly reward and attain love; they are mutually exclusive. Scorsese’s films have been, to one degree or another, about human greed driving a wedge between men and God."
Scorsese delivers a formally brilliant film. [Full review in Spanish]
"Killers of the Flower Moon, for all its strength and beauty, will go down in history as an also-ran, relegated to second or third tier in the director’s filmography. And still, Scorsese has made a powerful and important film."
Scorsese's film is a cinematically poetic well-told tale of toxic masculinity partially shaped by racism but the complicated racism in Oklahoma is only hinted at.
...the story is better told as a limited series...
"A worthwhile journey, despite taking a bloody long time to get where it's going."
"No one likes storytelling as much as Martin Scorsese does, which means there can be no greater living American director.  In this film, he paints a vivid picture of a fascinating tale without missing a single beat"
"This is a movie that fully illustrates the twin evils of racism and corruption. The more things change, the more they remain the same. So it was a hundred years ago, so it is now."
"The film is haunting and memorable, which considering the budget and talent is its own sizable achievement.

"
"It is a story of murder, manipulation, and survival, an engrossing, deliberate work that also has expansive, unexpected moments and disconcerting juxtapositions. It is packed with vivid cameos and has three striking performances at its centre."
What an interesting story this is.
"Kudos to Scorsese’s longtime editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, for a pace that never lags even at three and one-half hours."
It’s a film with an unyielding commitment to the power of cinema and artistic expression.
Killers of the Flower Moon sorprende. Es una película extraordinaria realizada por un reparto y un equipo igualmente de impresionante. Lily Gladstone merece cada gramo de elogio que recibirá por este papel.
"Killers of the Flower Moon is some of Martin Scorsese's best work. It's not perfect but from the production, locations, the score, the performances and every moment of silence is powerful, purposeful and more than worth the run runtime."
"The film’s scope (and runtime) suggest weight and gravitas in recounting one of the great American sins, essentially distilling decades of genocide and horror into a compressed criminal event"
"They’ve transformed a procedural into an inquiry; an unsettling examination of soul sick men who are strangers to themselves. In other words, they turned it into a Scorsese movie."
"This is an appalling episode and an entirely legitimate subject for a film ... However, Scorsese does not treat the subject well. The three-and-a-half hour work is muddy, murky, repetitive and misanthropic, and even interminable in certain stretches."
Killers of the Flower Moon is both a faithful adaptation and a masterful epic from Martin Scorsese.
"It’s another masterpiece from an American legend, telling what’s perhaps the most essentially American story of his career."
"Scorsese exposes another of many genocides in American history, with a dramatic opera where all the elements work at maximum capacity. (Full review in Spanish)"
A minor step forward at a moment when major steps could be taken.
"Whether the lengthy runtime is justified is debatable, but what isn’t is Scorsese’s vision and memorable execution of a complex, heart-breaking tale of lies and deception."
"Ultimately, it is Gladstone that provides the heart and soul of “Moon.” Some might recognize the actress from recent films Certain Women and First Cow, but this is an absolute breakout moment for a very talented actress. "
"Expertly made on every level, the film never boils over, maintaining a riveting simmer of menace so urgent that we don't want to blink."
"With its sweeping prairie vistas and a terrific score, this grim, important story of crimes against First Nations people as the US tried to leave its frontier culture behind, need not have been delivered at a slow, deliberate pace"
"Scorsese crafts the film like a great American epic, infused with the spirit of John Ford and Howard Hawkes, examining the rot beneath the mystique of the American west. "
"Scorsese and De Niro are both 80 years old, and it’s an uncomfortable truth that neither of them likely has many more movies this good left in the tank. Thankfully, they have given us this one, and it’s something to treasure."
"Scorsese keeps his audience engaged enough to educate more than entertain, and some things still feel incomplete, even with the 3 hour runtime."
"Martin Scorsese's masterful movie is a fatalistic American epic of greed and violence, without any false idealism, as well as a brutal true-crime story. "
"Credit the writers, director,, cinematographer, production designer and costumer for immersing audiences in authentic Osage traditions, vivid pageantry and spiritual tribal customs. But running 3-hours--26-minutes. there should have been an intermission."
"At a whopping 206 minutes, Killers of the Flower Moon is worth the bedsores ...  History should be remembered — but not repeated — and [this film] will serve as an enduring statue of this tenet."
Killers of the Flower Moon is a visual masterpiece.
"A sprawling epic, “Killers of the Flower Moon” boasts award winning performances by the three leads, who breathe life into characters that would come off as two dimensional in the hands of lesser actors."
The power of Killers of the Flower Moon will only continue to grow in the decades to follow. Every minute of his three-and-a-half-hour epic pulses with political and practical commentary.
"Ever at it's 19 hour runtime, Killers of the Flower Moon stays consistently great!"
"In the hands of a lesser filmmaker, this deliberate genocide would’ve been milked for tears and screams. But in Killers of the Flower Moon, death comes with serenity and silence."
"Every frame in Killers of the Flower Moon is worthy of admiration. Its unforgiving violence, its cruel characters, its take on the greed of the human condition. As expected, Scorsese brings this relentless tale to the big screen in a unique manner."
"In the end, Killers of the Flower Moon, for all its flaws, is a moving, devastating, and utterly tremendous piece of cinema that demands attention and reflection."
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a really good movie but it is not the great movie you expect it to be."
"Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon is an admirable, thoughtful film. But it lacks the wild, old Marty energy that brought us so many Scorsese classics."
"Tragic, stately, sombre, bluntly violent, Martin Scorsese’s new epic is a crime drama set in the vast spaces of the American West and the intimate corners of the heart."
"Tempting for a less thoughtful and empathetic white filmmaker to tell this story from the Osage point of view...and, yes, the film is good. It's a straight-line slog with a tension wire held across its proverbial forehead for the duration, but good? Sure."
Watch the film for its true-to-life depiction of one of the harshest chapters of American history. And also for the wealth of acting talent displayed by all. 
Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon is another storytelling masterclass and examination of 20th-century American histories of greed and destruction.
"Telling the story of the mass murder of the Osage Nation, Martin Scorsese wrestles with himself, Hollywood as a whole, and the original sin of America itself."
"In its empathetic, unflinching portrayal of what the Osage Nation went through, Martin Scorsese’s latest epic more than earns its extravagant run time."
"Mysterious, tender, and balancing life between two cultures, Gladstone gives a memorable performance."
"In the end, it’s clear that there’s a real and objective truth being presented here about justice, power, and responsibility; thanks to the mastery of a great American filmmaker, with the help of a stellar cast delivering career-highlight performances."
"Killers of the Flower Moon is an exercise in kaleidoscopic, cubist storytelling that is, among other things, an epic on the art of the grift."
"In telling the story of the Osage murders, the director strips everything down—and the result is pure horror, laid bare."
Killers of the Flower Moon feels epic and sweeping. It stirs outrage and asks us to look at a brutal moment in history. But I just wish the magnificent Gladstone and her Mollie had been given full centerstage.
"Unlike the visions of unbounded freedom found in traditional westerns, Martin Scorsese’s new film is a study of a West bounded by the vertical geometry of oil rigs and the violent conspiracies of powerful men."
Killers of the Flower Moon offers a vivid and compelling study of racism as domestic violence.
"Gladstone is extraordinary in the film’s most important yet also most enigmatic role. She has a tenderness, a wariness, a remoteness, at times a bravery..."
Scorsese's film is a benchmark in how popular culture understands the American West and the Indigenous experience.
The star-making turn comes from Gladstone...
Scorsese’s first Western spins a vivid tale of greed and murder.
"Much like he did with Silence and The Irishman, Killers of the Flower Moon subverts the Martin Scorsese script for something more doleful and introspective. "
Scorsese's latest may be his finest.
"“Killers of the Flower Moon” is not a great film, but it is an important one. "
Absolutely titanic.
"The result is a film that could have been leaner and tauter if judicially edited. For some reason, it does not feel like a ""Martin Scorsese Film"" to me."
"What gives the film moral potency is our feeling that Ernest, Mollie and practically everyone else know all too well the parts they play in this tale."
"With an incredible cast and crew, and a factual screenplay co-written with Eric Roth and crafted with the participation of the Osage Nation, Martin Scorsese delivers yet another astonishing piece of cinematic art with Killers of the Flower Moon."
Feels like a film we're going to be talking about years from now.
"It’s an opulent, indulgent crime/drama/history film made from bits of facts and padded with fiction. Nothing more."
"Flower Moon is at once a crime epic, a spiritual exorcism, a portrait of a ne’er-do-well, a black comedy about the FBI’s birth, and a ballad of those who didn’t see modernity coming."
"I adored the Irishman; it was one of my favorite of [Scorsese's] films for probably about 25 years, and this is right up there."
"Yes, the film is three and a half hours. What’s so impressive about it is how Scorsese manages to inject urgency into even small moments."
Killers of the Flower Moon is Shakespearean in its reach and complexity.
"It's still a good film, fundamentally... but it's not epic enough or personal enough either. "
Classic Scorsese in that it's basically the mafia transported from New York to Oklahoma with De Niro as a prairie-Godfather. But not even the great Scorsese can manage to keep enough tension in a 3.5 hour-long movie to keep things interesting. 
"With Killers of the Flower Moon, Scorsese sets out to shine a harsh light on that horrific aspect of the US’s all-too-recent history and illustrate how it’s very much part of this country’s living legacy, and succeeds.
"
"The structure and killer reveal are a little wonky, and at times it feels like Roth and Jeff Rendell are trying to shoe horn in elements from the faux trailer, but the kills are solid and the vibe is very fun"
"A gory good time that doesn't aspire to be anything more than a fun slasher, a goal that it wholeheartedly achieves."
"This is an insane experience but in the best way. This over-the-top kill-fest sticks to its guns until the very end and provides some memorable thrills along the way. The protagonists blend together and feel unmemorable, but the tone is consistent."
The film's well-executed (pun intended) thrills make it a feast. 
"...a passable endeavor that generally does feel like it should be much, much better."
"This gory slasher movie is happily absent director Eli Roth's former cruel, misogynistic touches, taking instead a playful, self-aware approach that's both fun and darkly funny. "
"Yes, the premise is silly, but the movie knows it, winking at the audience with absurd scenarios and over-the-top gore."
It is more attuned to contemporary trauma than any other movie. This horror flick about modern obscenity helps us see it for ourselves.
It's a fun movie to see with a crowd.
"This does what it does really well, and I had a good time."
This festive special is grisly laughs done just right.
A new film to be thankful for.
"Thanksgiving not only pays homage to, and, at the same time, parodies the classic slasher, but brings it to the era of the iPhone and social networks. [Full review in Spanish]"
A fun slasher that plays on the tropes of the genre really well. It might not break new ground but it delivers on the classic elements that make the genre enjoyable for fans.
Eli Roth delivers his finest horror movie yet in the holiday slasher Thanksgiving. 
"The brutal murders aren’t even the grossest aspect of this movie, and that’s kind of the genius of it."
"It’s outrageously gory, uproarious, and, at rare moments, even gently philosophical."
"It’s easily one of Roth’s best horror banquets — gory, ridiculous and over the top. "
It's a feast for those who savor dark-humored slashers.
" A few moments are not written or directed as well as they could be, but overall, Thanksgiving serves up a festive, gore-stuffed treat for horror aficionados."
Performing the requisite duties of a slasher film with the most sincerity and highest level of quality it can manage.
Thanksgiving serves up the gorily delicious goods.
"No matter how predictable or formulaic the outcome may be, Roth’s execution is sharp and effective, delivering everything a horror fan could want from a holiday-themed slasher."
"While it had some interesting and creative kills a lot of what you see in the film has already been done in I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream, My Bloody Valentine and Valentine. I expected a little more from Eli Roth."
"It’s full of clichés, but that’s kind of the point, as a tribute to 80s slasher films."
"Just as overwrought as the short, Thanksgiving is a love letter to slashers like Scream and Roth's own Hostel series — which sounds cliché, and that's the point."
" It might taste good for a bite or two, but Eli Roth’s “Thanksgiving” isn’t a full meal."
What a horror feast… you’ll want second helpings.
"Perhaps it’s how unlikable I found most of the characters or just the tone of the evening, but while effectively moody and gory, it ultimately didn’t play for me as well as films like Terror Train or My Bloody Valentine."
"Those looking for a straightforward slasher that delivers bloody, entertaining kills with the right dose of humor will not be disappointed."
"A fun ride from start to finish, and though it maybe isn’t self-aware enough it certainly isn’t dour and depressing. While this turkey may have been slightly undercooked, it was still a blast and a nice serving of B-movie fun."
Eli Roth has not been fun to watch for quite a few years. This is fun to watch. 
 It’s sleekly efficient and delivers both some solid suspense sequences and one of the more imaginatively grotesque images I’ve seen in a lifetime of watching horror movies
"With inventive kills, a memorable villain and slices of what Roth does best, it easily has the potential to become a November staple for horror lovers."
[Eli] Roth doesn’t disappoint when it comes to the brutal killing and gore department.
"If you're here for the gore and the kills, you'll be satisfied. The ending is a really clever wrap up."
Thanksgiving is Eli Roth’s most enjoyable film to date. The holiday horror film is his most socially-relevant film executed with humor and scares
"With Thanksgiving, Roth marries R-Rated violence with a sense of humor and the same kind of energy that puts all those butts in seats. The result is a film that is inconsequential but also a hell of a lot of fun."
The opening vision of retail hell proves to be the best horror sequence. The later murders are just basic ghoulish fun and rarely have a Thanksgiving theme.
"As an important genre auteur’s return to his origins and a paean to the slasher subgenre’s legacy, Thanksgiving works just fine."
Grindhouse fans have been waiting for the full length THANKSGIVING film for 16 years and Eli Roth delivers! 
"The ingredients are absolutely familiar, but what makes the whole recipe satisfying is the sheer amount of gruesome fun Roth manages to have with the concept. "
jugular veins are shredded; people are trampled; the fallen are scalped; and bones are broken. This flick is not for the faint-hearted. Roth demonstrates the meta-awareness of the “Scream” franchise without having dialogue belabor the point. 
Tonally this is a little shaky and the early promise of some serious satire is never really followed up on. But plenty of annoying losers die very gory deaths and that's exactly the point of this kind of film.
"There were a lot of ways this Thanksgiving meal could have been ruined. Thankfully, it was not. In fact, I enjoyed it so much, I want to go back for seconds!"
"‘Thanksgiving’ is no turkey as Eli Roth carves his own path into a holiday-themed horror franchise by serving up a feature stuffed with gore, comedy, and nostalgia. It may not become as traditional as the Macy’s Parade but seconds seem to be in order."
"From the Black Friday massacre to a horrifying Thanksgiving dinner, the kills are brutal and, surprisingly, wacky. Despite being helmed by Eli Roth and featuring rising stars, Thanksgiving is weighed down by a weak script and forgettable characters."
Thanksgiving may shock those who have come to equate “horror” with PG-13 jump-scares but it will fill the bellies of those yearning for inventive killings and a menu of viscera.
"Eli Roth’s Thanksgiving doesn’t entirely deliver on the promise of the 2007 trailer, but slasher fans will enjoy the practical gore and black humor. "
Roth spares no creative expense (or bodily organ) in slaughtering his mostly disposable victims. Unfortunately that same attention isn’t given to the script which only exists to usher us from one bloody murder to the next.
"While the narrative does resemble other slashers that have come before it, the brutality and abruptness at which the kills happen, combined with exaggerated Massachusetts characters, help to create laughs along with the squirms."
"Thanksgiving is an affectionate, entertaining homage to a subgenre that was often derided."
"After many years with a lot of high concept slasher films, it feels great to back to the basics..."
It checks off a lot of boxes that have been missing from too many genre entries today. Shock value? Check. Gore? Big time.
"Paper-thin, disposable characters and cheap scares accompany Thanksgiving, Eli Roth’s latest B-movie venture based on his Grindhouse short."
Thanksgiving is less a movie than a messy attempt to coast off an oldie-but-goodie one-off without adding anything to the party. It can 100 percent go stuff itself.
Eli Roth’s latest ensures his horror films continue their tradition of subverting traditions. Especially the sacred ones.
"Thanksgiving overflows with gross-out violence and corny one-liners. The dialogue grates the nerves, and the characters play as one-dimensional and entitled imbeciles."
"This is the guy who made Hostel trying to invent a new slasher horror icon with gory kills and dense mythology to boot...Thanksgiving doesn’t reinvent the genre, but it adds some nice new fixings to the table."
"Thanksgiving is funny, bloody and charmingly self-aware... [Full review in Spanish]"
"A new fun, bloody holiday tradition."
"Roth and Rendell find the perfect balance of humor and horror, understanding the absurdity of their premise while still making their characters buy into the world."
"Thanksgiving easily lived up to the hype of that initial trailer so many years ago and should remain a holiday staple for years to come. Not only is this the best export from the Grindhouse experiment (sorry, Machete), this is Eli Roth’s best film yet."
"If all you want to do is watch an assortment of teenagers and others get carved up in garish ways, Thanksgiving certainly gets the job done."
No originality and no thrills but enough stomach-churning gore to keep the scaremongers happy.
I had a surprisingly bloody fun time.
"Thanksgiving is tired stuff, glib and nasty. Scooby Doo with sadism."
"Thanksgiving is a glorious violent, darkly humorous and thoroughly entertaining horror film."
"You can’t have well-done social satire without follow-through, and Roth ultimately isn’t aiming his darts where he should be."
"By the time the big reveal comes along, it’s almost beside the point. The audience, so numbed by the gore, is likely to barely care who indeed did it."
"“Thanksgiving” feels like Roth has finally assembled the best bits of his previous movies and meshed it with a story filled with plenty of intrigue and mystery, including a final act that, against all odds, sticks the landing. An instant slasher classic!"
"While it’s somewhat tamer than many of Roth’s previous outings, there is definitely some thought and creativity put into the murders — a few of which were lifted directly from the early teaser. "
"A wickedly entertaining ride that manages to be both frightening and thought-provoking, ensuring that this holiday season, audiences will be left with more than just the taste of cranberry sauce."
"Most importantly, it’s great seeing him back in the genre he clearly cares about the most, having fun, delivering a few choice jolts of fear, and opening the tap on the blood flow. Plus, it’s a holiday-themed movie, so bring the whole family."
It’s a simple premise and similar to what we’ve seen before - but Roth’s dedication to a more classical filmmaking style gives this a far more grounded feel than your usual slasher flick.
"Horror comedies are tricky. The laughs tend to destabilize the scary stuff. Has anyone ever wished there were a couple more chuckles in ""Alien,"" or a fart joke in ""Frankenstein""?"
"Broad stock types are hardly a weakness in the slasher subgenre; they can be wielded to tremendous effect. But when a work is this aesthetically dull and unoriginal, each retread of familiar tropes works against what little the movie is able to achieve."
"Like Thanksgiving dinner, it wouldn't be healthy to consume this sort of thing every day, but about once a year, it can hit the spot."
"There’s loads of fun to be had with Thanksgiving, a horror-comedy offering from slashmeister Eli Roth that blends laughs with lots of excessive gore that briefly crosses the line into outright vileness, pretty much like Roth did in Hostel II.

"
"Eli Roth’s holiday blood feast knows what it’s trying to do, and it has a lot of fun doing it.
"
"For giddy gore-hounds, Roth’s Thanksgiving is a bloody feast to savour. "
Immediately cements itself as a seasonal classic.
"This is a slashers fan dream; KILLER opening, creative kills, a homage to 80’s/90’s classics with a solid whodunnit at its core. This turkey is STUFFED with with such goodness from start to finish. "
"Served hot, Roth’s Thanksgiving is so good you’ll lick it off your fingers… or someone else’s."
"Slightly overcooked and would benefit from a trim... Still, it’s hard to criticize Roth too harshly for what is ultimately the kind of movie we need more of: perfectly enjoyable, mid-budget horror films with simple hooks and solid splatter."
"Thanksgiving is gory, gross, sick, and demented with a few laughs thrown in for good measure."
"Thanksgiving is dull and drawn out, and Roth's wry, sick sense of humor is stretched bare across a series of characters as thin as watery gravy."
"Far from elevated horror or other genre films that force the viewer to think, Thanksgiving is the goriest party of the season. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The humor is situational without being painfully contrived, and the horror is gory without being over the top. This is not to say that John Carver’s victims don’t go out in a spectacular bloody style, I mean for mainstream audiences and an R rating."
"The gore and slapstick work well together, however whenever the film leans into its comedy elements with silly one-liners it doesn’t quite manage to pull it off. Still, Roth has crafted a fun if somewhat forgettable slasher with Thanksgiving."
"It's a memorable addition to the pantheon of great slasher openings, and reveals two essential lists: one of potential killers, and one of seemingly inevitable victims, plus the clear if not overly memorable final girl in Jessica (Verlaque). "
"In the pantheon of holiday slashers launched by the iconic OGs – Black Christmas, Halloween, April Fool’s Day – America’s day of thanks finally has its flagship, Thanksgiving serves up a heaping plate of gory goodness, and horror fans will eat it up."
"a new gory comedy horror holiday classic...Eli Roth (""Hostel”) has not only delivered on every beat of his 2007 trailer, but he’s done so with the sick invention of many “Final Destination” films and character and genre cliché derived humor."
"But although the end result is likely to be a little too gruesome and Grand Guignol for many, underneath its somewhat tired take on traditional tropes, telegraphed twists and attempt to homage... it’s actually a surprisingly artful and entertaining watch."
"While calling it Roth’s best film may not carry the most weight, “Thanksgiving” easily affirms that when his script isn’t simply a pile of guts, he can be a wicked good entertainer."
"[I]t's a pleasant surprise that Roth's satirical aims are ... sharp ... Once they're out of the way, though, the movie becomes a mixed bag of horror and comedy."
"Thanksgiving is a slasher for today, slickly made, coolly mean, and with a satiric bite.

"
"Horror for [Roth] is a blunt instrument. The thing is, he knows his stuff and he’s very adept at serving up both gross-outs and real leap-from-your-seat moments."
"It’s easy to see how this movie will become a new holiday tradition for genre fans, to be watched after grandma and grandmpa have fallen into a post-turkey coma."
"There is no denying that the kills are disturbingly fun to watch, but it’s all stuffed into a film that’s unsure if it wants to fully assume the tone of its fictitious trailer or spend time functioning as a bland mystery
"
"The first act is the strongest, and as the narrative shifts to the third act, it loses sight of its thesis."
"The structure may challenge some viewers, but those who stay engaged will find plenty of awkwardness offering a distinct cinematic pleasure."
"It has more to say than anticipated, and while the message doesn’t feel fully explored, there is an originality to this concept that remains intriguing throughout. The way it seamlessly shifts between genres is impressive."
"The first half of the film is very funny but once the story turned dark, I was hit with overwhelming sadness while watching Paul’s life fall apart. The final act goes a bit off the rails but Cage is terrific. Heavy Ari Aster vibes.   "
"I really like Cage, and Julianne Nicholson as his wife, but the end result was flat. A movie about nightmares turned into one, proving third acts are everything for a concept film. "
Nicolas Cage delivers a deft comedic performance while simultaneously breaking your heart.
Screenplays serving up increasingly important references to Freddy Krueger and mixing them in with names such as Barack Obama and Joe Rogan do not and will not come along often enough to miss this one.
"While it doesn’t fully explore some of the complex issues it unearths, this character study about privacy and perception shows a lot of truth in its fantastical premise."
"Borgli shows what happens when unfounded fears run amok and we pass judgment on people based on events that are entirely manufactured by our own hippocampus. And most impressively, ""Dream"" does all this while remaining wickedly funny."
"It's got a lot of real world truths to it, but [It's] not the most novel story in the world."
"If I would recommend it at all, it would be just to see what Cage is doing here, which I think is really terrific."
Dream Scenario is one of the best films of the year.
"Struggles in its shift from darkly comic to bubonic, but Cage's nebbish performance remains a constant delight."
"At best, it’s an unfinished thought from a filmmaker who’s written himself into a corner. At worst, it’s a poorly argued diatribe against cancel culture that knows the punchlines, but doesn’t understand the jokes it’s telling."
"Nicolas Cage is everywhere all at once in this dark and brilliantly doolally satire.

"
Perhaps the best Charlie Kaufman movie that Charlie Kaufman had nothing to do with.
“Dream Scenario” is a delightful treat for Cage fans that doesn’t wear out its welcome – though it also doesn’t leave the strongest of final impressions.
"It’s a caustically clever fantasy parable that plays with the notions of “viral” fame and “cancel culture,” though in the end I found it more intriguing as a concept than terribly rewarding in either comedy or insight."
"With its surreal delirium and hilarious black humor, Dream Scenario is a pleasant surprise. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Cage, recommitted the last few years after spending ages on Hollywood's fringes, dials down his mania and lets everything around him be eccentric and outlandish; he's the straight man in this oddball world, and it suits him well. "
"With its offbeat blend of warped humor, dramatic and horror elements, social commentary, and Talking Heads, Dream Scenario may not always be comfortable but it is undeniably provocative."
"Borgli proves to be a voice to pay attention to as “Dream Scenario” is a daring, pointed piece of work that should be heeded, while Cage reminds us how vital a screen presence he can be when given challenging material.
"
"Nicolas Cage mostly keeps things on the road in this intriguing black comedy about a nobody who randomly starts appearing in people's dreams. It’s a caustically funny but also makes you think, and even cringe."
"I LOVED the concept, paired with a interesting take on instant modern online fame & what happens when cancelled. Nicolas Cage plays the nerdy college professor haunting people’s dreams perfectly."
"It’s a picture that stumbles along rather than progresses in any strictly linear sense. 
But that sometimes frustrating unconventionality — sometimes funny, often not — and the riveting presence of Nic Cage on center stage recommend it"
Dream Scenario becomes an unnervingly accurate portrayal of our whole cultural attention span.
"A pointed, thought-provoking satire about the undesirable side effects of fame, the addictive nature of technology and the sublime mysteries of the mind, where ids and egos sometimes run free, or run amok."
"I like this film very much... Think of it as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or Being John Malkovich, neither of which nailed the landing. This one does."
"Nicolas Cage uses every bit of his talent to play an irredeemable, self-loathing character trapped in a nightmare scenario in Kristoffer Borgli’s Dream Scenario."
Borgli weaves comedy and tragedy seamlessly in this bizarre rollercoaster ride. Fun seeing Cage relish in playing various facets of his character with impeccable comic timing.
"As the story progresses, Borgli broadens its scope, taking glancing blows at academia, cancel culture, viral online exposure, student over-sensitivity, and misplaced judgments, people refusing to take responsibility for their dreams. "
"Nicolas Cage is comedic in a dry, subtle, nakedly painful way, playing with his ‘Cage rage’ persona; his performance is profoundly moving. I only wish the film was more deserving of what he’s doing."
An interesting premise and strong lead performance help makeup for a ridiculous third act.
"For those on the same absurdist wavelength, this captivating satire is a sharply amusing takedown of cancel culture, social-media paranoia, and corporate opportunism."
"This is a bizarre commentary on cancel culture, as well as a fascinating extrapolation of the Mandela Effect... Like many of Cage’s projects, it’s not likely this movie will appeal to everyone, but it’s enticing "
A hilariously discombobulating movie that also has the best Cage performance in years.
"Dream Scenario does feature some surreal dream sequences, but it’s not really about dreams. It’s about life as a modern, viral celebrity, on display in the unblinking eye of the public, social media and cancel culture."
"It seems modern, but Dream Scenario is tapping into a lot of basic facets of human life that existed way before the internet and prior to the concept of a meme even having a definition."
Cage is a dreamy choice for Borgli’s exceptional and eccentric dark comedy.
The movie seems unfocused and unwieldy. You know a movie loses steam when it pivots its narrative near the end.
The director has an imagination for deep-sleep surrealism as well as a stomach for gutsy satire.
"It’s hard to imagine a world where Cage is a nobody. He plays that role well, but his evolution into a soured, angry cornered animal brings out the dark we love to watch. He doesn’t want to be in people’s dreams doing what he does. Or he says he doesn’t. "
"Rather than relying on bursts of mania, Borgli’s film is composed largely of bouts of polite consternation... Concise, sometimes elegant editing, <I>Dream Scenario</I> offers lovely images, some of simmering alarm, and some as serenely surreal as can be."
"It’s not a smug send-up of modern reality as much as it is a hilarious, beautifully told story of seeking recognition and wanting to become something greater than yourself while not seeing all the good in front of you."
"The brilliance of the film is that it never overplays its hand, despite hundreds of possibilities in which it could. Cage is perfect for the role because he knows when to turn up the jets … and when to perform the character as determined. Get in the Cage!"
"The strong setup is well served by Cage, who plays the self-serving, petty-yet-likeable protagonist flawlessly."
"These flaws are real, and yet there’s still something about Dream Scenario that resonates—a feeling for our contemporary, Milkshake-ducked zeitgeist that ultimately gives its allegory about the fleeting nature of fame a bit of staying power..."
"Dream Scenario expands into a larger commentary about how even our dreams can be co-opted and exploited, and we’ll leave it at that.

"
"It is perhaps a hair too self-satisfied for its own good, but it carries itself with such audacity that it’s difficult not to like."
"It’s a film that demands repeat viewings, careful consideration, thoughtful analysis, and an appreciation for one of the greatest fart jokes of the 21st century so far."
"Dream Scenario is at its most poignant in the pathos of Nicolas Cage’s performance. His Paul is both somewhat sympathetic ... and, frankly, deeply unlikable."
"The captain of the crazy ship is back with fitfully compelling ""Dream Scenario."" "
"I don’t think the third act of “Dream Scenario” works at all. It’s too obvious. However, its saving grace is Cage, whose petulance in these late sequences never ceases to be as funny as it is uncomfortable to watch."
"Cage leads the way with a superbly itchy performance which captures, with unnerving accuracy, the unmanageable process of notoriety in today’s society."
"The real, discomforting heart of the story ... is in its precise dissection of its main character..."
"Dream Scenario is one of the most original and creative films of 2023, highlighting the genius of Kristoffer Borgli and the excellence of Nicolas Cage."
"The best film of 2023 is a pitch-black existential comedy with a lot on its mind about unexamined fragility, ego, society's need to commodify and meme culture. It's a great showcase for Cage and proof that filmmaker Kristoffer Borgli has a lot to offer."
"Nicolas Cage goes delightfully, derangedly meta in Dream Scenario, a smart, dizzyingly entertaining horror-comedy that morphs into scathing social satire."
"With its sunny imagery, in-camera effects and cleverly offhanded performances, this is an astute satire of how anonymity can turn into both fame and notoriety. It's funny, unnerving and ultimately bracingly important."
"Because Cage is so good and the clearer ideas so effective, the bigger holes can mostly be looked over."
The whole film allows Cage to deliver a kind of meditation on the nature of movie-star fame — what it is like to fill the dreams of strangers and how little it has to do with you.
"Look past the more superficial commentary of the third act, and the world Dream Scenario depicts isn’t all that dissimilar from our own.
"
It’s a savagely funny showcase for Cage at his very best.
"Taking a page from Charlie Kaufman's bleak, surreal human-condition comedies, this movie sustains its interesting idea until the very end and benefits from Cage's fearless performance. "
"If Dream Scenario didn’t evince such potential in its concept, performances, and craft, its thematic issues and second-half problems wouldn’t sting quite so badly."
"Luckily, a central performance by Nicolas Cage as a mild-mannered academic watching his dignity get demolished keeps us watching. He is both the movie’s greatest weapon and, at times, too good for it."
The set-up inevitably allows Cage to get into wacky situations and the film is best when it’s an absurdist comedy about a family man struggling with success. It’s when it tries to make its central metaphor mean something that it slips up.
"Just like most dreams, this film doesn't quite know how to end. But with performances that don’t falter and one of the most excruciating sex scenes in history, I didn’t want to wake up."
Cage carries all with a blend of existential desperation and creepy ineffectualness (most memorably in the year’s most squalidly uncomfortable sex scene).
"In the end, “Dream Scenario” is what it criticizes, but with no great statement or great pivotal scene, just intriguing, oddball amusement. The movie isn’t just about memes; it is a meme."
"Whereas Jonze and Kaufman are happy to spelunk in the naval with existentially jarring absurd comedies, Dream Scenario utilizes the bizarre, fictional setup to probe real-world questions..."
It’s a morality play where one extramarital indiscretion produces disquieting ripples through the collective psyche of a country. Crucially it’s also funny.
"Dream Scenario is plenty fun, but also squanders the opportunity to be even more."
Dream Scenario is an amusing and fanciful black comedy somewhat in the manner of Charlie Kaufman.
Cage’s nuanced performance is one of his career best. 
"A smart, caustic comedy about the innate patheticness of the human experience, and how one person can be crushed by the expectations and vagaries of others."
"As the film turns into a parable about online fame and cancel culture, the laughs begin to dry up. Still, this wildly original and genuinely nightmarish comedy really does stay with you."
"The best parts of Dream Scenario are those dreams, the sequences in which Borgli pushes the medium and himself into unsettling, hallucinatory territory. "
"My ultimate issue with the movie is that I just don't have much reason to care about Paul being ""canceled."""
"Dream Scenario is the cancel culture satire that we didn't know we needed and if that's not enough, Nicolas Cage turns in one of his best performances to date."
Nicolas Cage has perhaps never been Nicolas Cagier in what could be his Nicolas Cagiest performance ever.
"Dream Scenario is a darkly comedic delight, immensely enjoyable and oddly satisfying -  a Cage career highlight,"
Dream Scenario is such an imaginatively offbeat movie that it’s a shame it isn’t better.
"Borgli’s scenario might falter as it goes along, but Cage is a dream. "
"Dream Scenario offers interesting ideas about fame and the power of perception versus reality. Although the ending of this satirical comedy/drama is a little too rushed, there's enough in the movie to keep viewers guessing on what will happen next."
"Borgli, in his English-language feature debut, delivers a transfixing, wickedly funny cringe comedy about the dangers of celebrity that manages to walk the line between goofy satire and secretly horrific indie drama."
"We walk away from this funny, sad, scary film acutely reminded that if fame has two sides, one of them is pretty darned horrible."
Dream Scenario is too convinced of its own ingenuity to see where its walls are and expand its vision accordingly.
"While often intellectually engaging and occasionally howlingly funny (the film’s outrageously honest sex scene is one for the books), Borgli’s English-language debut rarely feels like more than a souped-up episode of The Twilight Zone. "
"It’s certainly the most Nicolas Cage film since the last Nicolas Cage film, whenever that was. Plus it is entertaining. Mostly."
"Comically and dramatically, it could go here, there or anywhere. And for a while, director Kristoffer Borgli seems able to take us to each of those places at once."
"If writer/director Borgli is a jazz musician riffing on his outrageous theme, Cage is his scat singer, hitting notes of panicked wonder we didn’t know existed on the scale."
"As Paul is raised up and ruined by his own entirely unearned viral success, Borgli offers a surreal, ultimately sad satire of 21st-century online exposure."
"The film is moment-to-moment lively, sharp, and funny. Too bad that, like a dream, its pleasures are all over the place, and dissipate almost as quickly as they arrive."
"Pondering the downside of notoriety and our willingness to exchange safety for fame, “Dream Scenario” is often funny and frequently surreal."
"Capturing America’s culture war insanity with several loony and hilarious sequences, Dream Scenario is a fitting whirlwind story of the ups and downs of overnight fame
"
"With Dream Scenario, Borgli has crafted a compelling film where fantasy bleeds into reality and vice versa and the truth is so skewed it’s difficult to know who to trust."
"Borgli has a lot of ideas, and perhaps wove a few too many into “Dream Scenario,” which is busy with cultural commentary but not exactly deep. "
"Silly, strange, and very funny, Dream Scenario is a psycho-comic-drama with a peak Cage Renaissance performance powering it. Don’t sleep on it."
"Ultimately, Dream Scenario is predicated on too modest an idea that simply isn't sturdy enough to support the film’s hefty allegorical ambitions."
"I feel like they played it ""safe"", which significantly lowered the stakes for me. I loved the short running time but this movie struggled to find its footing. "
This is far from the worst MCU film. It's actually quite charming and had some fun fight scenes. But tonally it was all over the place. Shout out to Iman Vellani who is incredible. 
"Inconsistent, interminable - and silly!"
It could have been a lot worse. 
"The primary plot lines are fun, yet they can also be confusing, and at times it becomes a little too much--although totally enjoyed the three lead girls working together."
It's not going to win over people that are on the fence... but it's not bad.
"The Marvels is a diverting, easy to digest cosmic adventure that zips by at a breakneck pace and reminds us of the importance of family and friendship."
"Brie Larson leads a super-trio that works hard to blast some fun into this confusing adventure.

"
"“The Marvels” delivers a fun, well-paced superhero movie anchored by three solid, charismatic performances.  "
"Oh boy, I am so tired of the MCU... Now it's the same film over and over and over again. "
"This is false sophistication, especially in this case, when it covers up the visual ineptitude and chaos of The Marvels. "
"The whole ""Captain Marvel"" franchise is diluted and shredded in this average action thriller."
"[The Marvels] feels like the finale to a season of television we never got, and perhaps a series would have given each of these characters the time they needed to fully explore each of their individual issues."
"It’s all rather standard superhero sci-fi ... with the welcome variation that almost all of the key characters are women. Vellani is funny and sweet as Kamala, an unabashed Captain Marvel fangirl who doesn’t hide her excitement at joining the fray. "
"If Marvel is trying to win back audience enthusiasm, centering its characters and a sense of fun is the right approach. And teaming up with talented directors like Nia DaCosta goes a long way on executing that approach"
"It's not a disaster—it's too entertaining and too well-acted to be that. I loved how imaginative it can be; action scenes are sufficiently exciting, and visual effects are better polished than those of other recent superhero films. Full review in Spanish."
It's disappointing this film will be written off as an MCU flop because its superior to plenty of other entries in the franchise that fared better at the box office.
"The story is actually very tragic, but Marvel doesn't allow it to be so as to not leave out any jokes. As a result, not everything has the space it needs to develop. [Full review in Spanish] "
"Directed by Nia DaCosta, “The Marvels” even gives short shrift to Goose, the orange cat who steals scenes with abandon."
"Gleefully silly, wonderfully charming, inventive, funny, and dramatic. It is also so reliant on its audience having seen multiple streaming serials that it’s honestly like a popcorn flick assigned its audience homework."
"The Marvels was seemingly designed to coast, bringing nothing that we haven’t seen before."
"Ably synthesizes the narrative strands of Captain Marvel, WandaVision, and Ms. Marvel with plentiful laughs and Marvel’s typical top-notch action — albeit with some initial choppiness."
...an impossibly incoherent endeavor that strikes all the wrong notes right from the get-go...
"While there are parts that are too thin and a few mystifying plot holes, the movie more than makes up for them with an irreverent and joyful story about found family that features truly wonderful chemistry between its three leading women."
"DaCosta’s film sings and is a breath of fresh air, rather than the MCU’s death rattle. Lifted by the chemistry of its leads - with a wonderful Vellani - it might not be top-tier, but it’s certainly enjoyable despite a handful of stumbles along the way."
"DeCosta brings a much-appreciated grounded approach to the story, while demonstrating a great sense of humor and ability to direct action. Meanwhile, Larson, Parris, and Vellani are simply dynamite together."
"There are problems with the plot, but I liked the interplay between the main characters. Zawe Ashton, playing Dar-Benn, is an especially effective villain. The movie does have a lot of humor in it and some good action scenes."
"While the titular Marvels make for an endearing, women-centric found family, the film’s hyperawareness of its role in a larger universe is its downfall."
"In this simple, entertaining sequel, Captain Marvel has grown past her wobbly origin story and into a bond with two other impressive women who make her temporary team"
"Despite a script that is chock full of good lines and a cast of willing participants, this is more meh than Marvel"
"The Marvels is still a joyous cinematic spectacle, and there are much worse ways to while away a rainy weekend afternoon with the kids. The Marvels is strong, simple, somewhat indistinct but satisfying all the same."
"Isn’t perfect, but it’s a damn good time, packed with some great universe developments, interesting twists, and a memorable performance from rising star Iman Vellani..."
"DaCosta keeps her cameras on the hop, barely pausing to allow the slower beats to hit, but the film's leads do serviceable work giving their characters heart, and with Vellani winning the bulk of the audience-winning funny dialogue."
"These are fundamental issues and, while the film has its moments, it’s never consistent enough to hit the spot. You want to enjoy it all the way through, but it never lets you."
"Call me old-fashioned, but even with fantasy superhero tropes I still want to care enough to follow the journey and invest in the outcomes. The Marvels lost me early and never won me back."
"Amid its putative decline, the franchise has unleashed some of its liveliest and strangest films, from the oedipal Shang-Chi to the operatic Eternals. The trend toward general wackiness continues with The Marvels."
"Though proceedings do improve once we reach a relatively coherent final act, the weak chemistry between the three leads never gets any better. "
Iman Vellani is a star and is absolutely captivating. 
"It’s silly and makes little sense, but it’s such a fun time at the movies. And isn’t that why we go to see movies in the first place? "
"If we cut through all the noise surrounding the film, and look at it for what it does and what it is, the easy conclusion is that it’s an entertaining, mid-tier MCU flick. "
"Continuing the story of at least four other Marvel projects, the film is structurally messy but provides a Flerken fun time with a lot to get excited over."
"Weaving together strands from various Marvel movies and series, this feels designed specifically for fans. But anyone will enjoy the nutty vibe that drives the chaotic plot, which is so formulaic that it requires no thought at all."
"I had fun, I really enjoyed it. Also, I'm a huge fan of Kamala Khan. Iman Velani is amazing. I was just so pleased to get more of her."
"I enjoyed this movie for what it was. It's a mess, there's a lot of problems in it, I'm not going to lie, but it's still a fun time, "
This is the kind of bad movie even the most cowardly critics can feel safe piling on.
"Plot wise, thanks to the proliferation of the Disney/Marvel properties, the movie is all over the place. It has to provide exposition about characters and developments associated with various TV shows, in addition to previous movies. "
"While it has its fill of entertaining repartee and a truly-inspired set piece featuring Goose and her goslings, the flavorless Villain du jour mixed with half-baked battle scenes places The Marvels among the MCU’s middling offerings. "
An agreeable superhero romp that zips by and actually feels good.
The Marvels is so poorly conceived and ineptly executed that it not only makes this a front-runner for the dubious honor of worst movie of the MCU but a contender for the worst superhero movie of all time.
"…just the usual actors adrift in front of green screen nonsense, with barely a hint of daylight or recognisable human behaviour, and lots of eye-rolling dialogue…"
"Even with wall-to-wall action, “The Marvels” feels almost formulaic in its story."
"It's been more than 4 years since the original, and it's like they're trying to decide if it's a gourmet meal or a fast-food combo. At 105 minutes, it's one of Marvel's shortest films, but don't let that fool you. Short doesn't always mean sweet."
"Nia DaCosta is talented, which is why some of this film feels like it wasn’t actively generated by artificial intelligence. However, not even Orson Welles could go in and rescue some of these movies from themselves these days."
"The Marvels is a colorful, clever, joyous film that dodges many -- but certainly not all -- of the issues of its recent predecessors. It keeps the tone light and moves at a quick pace and -- finally -- doesn’t abuse the audience with an onerous runtime."
"The Marvels is disjointed and inconsistent. Post-production editing and VFX was weak and it needed more breathing room to flesh out themes and character arcs. A bright spot; Iman Vellani shines throughout. 

The MCU needs focus on quality over quantity."
"A lot of things happen in The Marvels and most of them are either not understood or fail to make us care, buried by a production model that has run into a dead end. [Full review in Spanish] "
"To spell things out for the cheap seats, The Marvels is not a cinematic abomination, an affront against almighty God, a blight on childhoods everywhere. In point of fact, it’s pretty good!"
"THE MARVELS ... [has] three leads whose company is a joy. ... The villain’s murky motives take time to gel, and there’s word salad for some dialogue, but at its best moments, it’s an entertaining lark with genuine humor and endearing enthusiasm."
The rest is filler and pretty much just another comic book movie.
"It’s a shallow hodgepodge with an underdeveloped villain (Zawe Ashton), but it has quite a few entertaining scenes, including a funny one with lots of cats."
"DaCosta made room for The Marvels to be bright and playful, filled with characters that are impossible not to love."
You get the sense that everyone involved is going through the motions.
"Iman Vellani brings an energetic vibe to a lackluster story in THE MARVELS. However, Vellani along with Brie Larson and Teyonah Parris make a great and entertaining team in a space adventure."
"Feeling more like a drop-in and less like a pillar to build upon. This film feels weighed down by everything but a good story. In the end, I'll give it a grade of C and say that kids will enjoy it, but adults should wait until it hits streaming."
Don’t pull the plug on the MCU just yet.
"This is a mediocre Marvel movie at best. The script is bland...the villain is boring,.. After you leave the theater, in 5 minutes  you wonder, ""now, what did I just see?"".  You forget it that quickly. It's that forgettable. "
"The Marvels brings plenty of comedy and screwball oddity to keep the audience on its toes. However, there are flaws that peer through the cracks of the latest Marvel feature."
"A lot of the superhero stuff in The Marvels works really well. The middle section of the film, I can't stand. It feels like a comedy scene ripped from another movie."
"The Marvels is a vibrant and well paced film that's packed with extremely well photographed and choreographed action. It's also brimming with cast chemistry, and rocks a narrative that builds the team *and* the characters as individuals."
I enjoyed The Marvels more than I anticipated for a reason I didn’t expect: Iman Vellani as Ms. Marvel.
The Marvels is fun and entertaining enough with its lighter tone and surface-level gimmicks. Ms. Marvel is the standout by a mile! The weak script and obvious reshoots are continuing issues that has caused the recent decline of the MCU's quality.
"Starts at 11 and stays there. It's exhausting.  So is a script that is curiously both over-plotted and underwritten, and a tone that blithely leaps from high-stakes drama to not-quite-camp enough to save it. "
"'The Marvels' takes off with some turbulence but, fueled by great cast chemistry and MCU world-building, lands gracefully."
"The only lasting memorable highlight of all this genuine girl power becomes the voice of Barbra Streisand singing ""Memory"" to a screenful of cavorting cats. Naturally, it is just marvelous!"
"Sure, there’s spurts of enjoyable banter between this new trio … but there’s alarmingly little dramatic material to make it a substantial film."
Breezily enjoyable but not entirely satisfying.
"Instead of teen wannabe-Avenger joining a big girl movie, The Marvels instead has Captain Marvel and Monica Rambeau turn into tween dribble. This movie turns one of its most powerful heroes into a literal Disney Princess."
"“The Marvels” gets by mostly on the chemistry of its core three. Vellani, Parris, and Larson are an amazing team. Of course, it’s Vellani who steals the show with her unbridled joy and charisma."
"It's a charming sequel, hingeing on the most important thing about superheroes: their true strength lies not in their powers, but in their real identities."
"It’s an adequate time waster for fans, but this mid-level Marvel entry ain’t marvelous.
"
"Surprisingly fun and full of energy, this Marvel film blends three different characters into a great new team."
"... The audience is so tired of so much history and has lowered their expectations so much, that The Marvels, in its 'bare minimum' approach works perfectly in this phase of the franchise. [Full review in Spanish]"
A movie that has an incredible pace and timing. The Marvels uses that to make this among the lighter and more buoyant MCU films and allows for the performers to bounce off each other in fun ways. 
"[H]its like the summer popcorn blockbusters we want from Marvel... full of earnest emotion and enthusiasm, with a cool straightforward sci-fi story and plenty of unique action spectacle, and sporting a charming cast with terrific chemistry."
"Ultimately, The Marvels feels like it is just spinning its wheels, keeping these characters in motion long enough to get to the next chapter."
"It’s a story that focuses on well-developed relationships, entertaining locations that don’t overstay their welcome, and a reasonable plot that clocks in at a reasonable running time."
The only thing weaker than the script are the special effects moments. The movie comes across as rushed – despite all the extra time – from words to images.
"They triple-downed on the things that they knew drew eyes without really understanding exactly what made them tick, and we shouldn’t be surprised that we wound up with a movie like The Marvels as a result."
"The latest MCU film The Marvels shines in the stellar chemistry and action between its three leads, despite exhibiting some notable pacing issues."
"""The Marvels"" is a stellar, wildly fun sequel that outshines its predecessor in nearly every way and paves the way for a bright future ahead."
"While the entire cast carries out Nia DeCosta’s vision to the hilt, the standout actor is Iman Vellani."
There's no escaping the fact that most of this is better intended than executed.
"In Larson and Parris, there’s intelligence and strength with each having a flair for sarcasm. Their past life together also helps to add just a touch of the human element. Vellani brings unbridled enthusiasm to the screen."
"The Marvels triumphs as a dazzling spectacle that seamlessly combines action, heart, and a stellar cast."
"Pleasurably lightweight, its story unburdened by the off-screen drama of the studio that made it. The shortest film in the MCU at a runtime of 105 minutes, this sprightly sequel to 2019’s Captain Marvel operates like a breezy road-trip comedy."
The Marvels felt way more like a 90s movie than Captain Marvel; which was set in the 90s. I had fun with this silly film and families should too.
This wobbly addition to the overall saga does not pass muster as either a sequel to the 2019 Captain Marvel solo outing or a sum-of-its-parts team-up. 
"The Marvels exhibits a fun, frisky likability I haven’t encountered in an MCU film since Spider-Man: Homecoming."
"While it certainly fails to reaches the heights of MCU's halcyon days, The Marvels also manages to not feel burdened by the franchise's more recent missteps; mostly bolstered by a strong first two acts and the wonderful chemistry of its three leads. "
"A zippy, fun superhero tale that doesn’t overstay its welcome."
"For a film laced with body horror, hedonism and chauvinism, Poor Things is often hilarious."
"It’s a showcase for Stone, who rapidly goes from preverbal toddling to childlike wonder to restless adolescence... Her performance displays the balance and dexterity of a chainsaw juggler."
"Impeccably crafted, Emma Stone delivers the performance of a lifetime in Yorgos Lanthimos' most accessible film. "
"a darkly hilarious, sexually provocative, visually Gilliamesque tale of a liberal, feminist awakening in the Victorian era."
"An elegantly weird, delightfully far-out skewering of class, culture and carnality."
The verdict is sad but unavoidable. “Poor Things” is a 141-minute mistake.
"Poor Things offers an opportunity for cinematic discovery. It’s brave, unconventional, and unique and easily one of the year’s best."
"While “Poor Things” is lively at times and gorgeously produced, Lanthimos comes dangerously close to self-parody with the feature."
"Visually stunning and one of the most thrilling watches of the season, Lanthimos’ film lets Bella grow as a character with Stone’s performance, and it works to give the audience time to fall in love with her."
"Poor Things, despite its absurdist, sensual, raunchy, and irreverent take on sex, is deeply sincere. Yorgos Lanthimos’s latest isn’t about physical intimacy so much as it is about building who you are through physical and emotional experience."
"Poor Things is a visionary delight, an entertaining and thoroughly ambitious project that makes the audience feel like they’re seeing the world for the first time."
"It is strange. It is stylish. It is at once daring, funny, beautiful and surreal. And it is undeniably, unequivocally unlike anything playing in theaters right now, a wonderfully weird and visually stimulating breath of fresh air."
"The film’s visual style is a sight to behold, and the acting is even better. This is the best film Lanthimos has made to date- and the best film of 2023. "
Bella’s odyssey is a delightful mix of hysterical black comedy and a thought-provoking feminist manifesto on personal evolution and revolution. 
"The film just transports you to another world. From the production design to the choices in color and texture, this truly is one of the most visually impressive films of all time!"
Filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos takes all the insanity and creativity from his previous films and applies them to his most ambitious and innovative work to date. Emma Stone delivers a performance for the ages. 
The combination of whimsy and sex positivity is certainly unique in the annals of cinema.
"Wildly funny, visually inspired, and thematically ambitious enough to warrant a sensory overload, Poor Things is a virtuosic and sensational wonder. "
"It’s plenty dark and absurd, but it’s the first time I can think of that the filmmaker has put out something not just lighthearted, but hopeful."
"“Poor Things” revels in the notion that, even at the last gasp, there may be a chance for Homo to grow a little more sapiens."
Poor Things is the unapologetic Lanthimos experience that makes him one of the most unique filmmakers working today.
What’s meant to be a coming-of-age tale of liberation and self-discovery is more of a shallow impression of womanhood marked by the director’s obsession with his own batty and bawdy style.
"Poor Things might seem bright and cheery, with costumes that pop and intricate sets that are equal parts beautiful and bizarre, but it gets heavy at times – unafraid to explore the harsh realities of life. Give Emma Stone all the awards."
"Yorgos Lanthimos' Poor Things is a horny, hedonistic, and hysterical gem of a film with an all-time great lead performance from Emma Stone. 

"
"All of the satire, the ominous drama, and the absurdist exchanges might still have worked, but the seemingly interminable running time ensures that the effective sequences are dulled by the ineffective ones."
"It is possibly the best film by Lanthimos, a filmmaker whose work oscillates between amorphous geniality and mockery, and the fact that he did not intervene with the script grants a fortituous ease to the film. [Full review in Spanish]"
Rather than a woman developing her own identity and exploring her femininity; the film presents a false sense of woman empowerment and sexual liberation which feels more like sexual fodder through the lens of the male gaze.
"While it could never be mistaken for a horror movie, I am quite certain it will horrify some folks, perhaps including Oscar voters. For others, though, Stone’s galvanizing Bella Baxter is sure to become a cinematic legend in her own right."
"here are moments of wildly disturbing body horror, hilarious comedy, and somber drama, sometimes all in the same scene. It’s frankly astonishing filmmaking, the kind of thing I haven’t seen in quite some time."
Poor Things is a simple story of discovery through a prism of complete and utter madness. Madness that works primarily due to Emma Stone’s jaw-dropping performance. 
"A daringly demented yet exuberantly raw pop-up fairytale that’s been cross-bred with first-wave science fiction... If there had been a few more snips with the storytelling shears, to shorten the experience, we’d have something near to perfection."
"Poor Things explicitly explores female sexual liberation. However, it’s less like a manifesto and more like an elevated sex comedy. "
[A] gonzo coming-of-age tale ... full of wry humor and critiques about misogyny and hypocrisy. I enjoyed it immensely.
"""Poor Things"" is as ambitious as Lanthimos has ever been. "
"Astonishing, breathtaking, a visual masterpiece. Bella transcends Barbie. She is the new female archetype. A sublime creature. Stone is miraculous! Ruffalo will never surpass this performance. All awards must go to this best picture of the last ten years."
The perverse coming-of-age tour de force we need right now.
"It’s a bit excessive, but never less than inspired."
"""Poor Things"" gives its ensemble cast room to explore the absurdity of life with extreme emphasis on Mark Ruffalo's dastardly and abusive Duncan. The film delights in its insanity, considerably to the advantage of those in on the joke."
"Yorgos Lanthimos grounds Poor Things, an undeniably wild, oft-offensive, sexually liberated black comedy, with a stirring sense of emotion and topical commentary."
"Watch our Poor Things video review from Chief Film Critic Jason Gorber: he discusses one of this year’s top films, with the visuals as a homage to the fun and distorted vision that Lanthimos brings to the big screen."
"A weird, occasionally gross, and very, very horny film that's also a hugely charming coming of age tale about a woman with an infectious warmth and lust for life. Emma Stone is perfect as Bella Baxter."
"Brought to vivid life by Stone’s energetic embrace of Bella’s persona, the universally excellent supporting performances and Lanthimos’ wild determination to surprise us."
"There's also the thing about the script, which undercuts its premise with needless curse words (designed to get a rise) and half-baked musings..."
Yorgos Lanthimos finally has his Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde. 
"It can be hysterically funny and incredibly disturbing, sometimes in the same beat, and it’s the most visually accomplished film that Lanthimos has made."
Emma Stone is the figure and the gaze that fuses Yorgos Lanthimos' wild and delirious visual movie... [Full review in Spanish]
"It may be visually extravagant, often going wildly over the top with full-on performances from a daring cast of excellent actors, and yet everything remains grounded in sympathetic emotions."
"Lanthimos revels in what these off-kilter worlds can tell us about our mirror universe, and while he and MacNamara have jettisoned the multi-narrator ambiguity of the novel in favour of its more fantastical bent, it does not undermine the feminist core."
"Yorgos Lanthimos' bold, dizzyingly insane (in the best possible way) new film ""Poor Things,"" defies genre categorization, although it could be the cinematic turkey baster love child of James Whale, Terry Gilliam, and Lars von Trier. "
 Its excess may grate on some but many are likely to be enamoured with Poor Things.
The story is… this singular movie. It is completely insane and completely grounded. Easily one of the best of 2023… a masterpiece… and likely headed to the canon.
"The maximalist ride is mostly a confection, lacking the full political bearing of the novel."
"It is a wickedly funny sci-fi romcom about a woman who learns to love herself in a world that undervalues her very existence. It also refreshingly shakes up the status quo when it comes to modern, mainstream filmmaking."
"It’s to the audience's delight to see a woman completely unfazed by what society expects from her in Poor Things. Its inhabitants are shaping around that rather than looking to snuff that fire out. Oh, what a world that would be."
" A mesmerizing, provocative, audacious and outrageously funny trip down the rabbit hole."
"A highly resonant ode to self-determination and independence. Not many could marshal this kind of visionary cinema, but we’re getting used to it from Lanthimos. "
"Stylish, sometimes surreal and generally captivating, with a masterclass central performance. Poor Things is not without its ethical blind spots and authorial quirks, but it’ll keep you talking long after the credits roll."
Its excess may grate on some but many are likely to be enamoured with Poor Things.
"Poor Things is an awe-striking visual feast that satisfies the eyes, tantalizes the loins, and feeds the soul. "
An ethnographer discovering the world and studying an animal called men. [Full review in Spanish]
"Poor Things is a whimsical and inventive creation that stands as Yorgos Lanthimos' best film yet. It is an ambitious tale of sex, bolts, second chances, and liberation led by a tour de force Oscar-worthy Emma Stone performance."
"Poor Things is beautifully shot, with production designs among the best of 2023.

While it does overindulge on itself and at times off-putting and overbearing, there’s a shade of brilliance as well. However, Emma Stone is might just lock Best Actress."
"Bold and uncompromising in its vision, Poor Things is cinematic art at its finest. Emma Stone gives a tour-de-force performance in this enthralling and sometimes amusing story about power, control, and independence in gender dynamics and female sexuality."
Poor Things is a splendidly peculiar adventure filled with surrealist oddities and dark hilarity in ways that only Lanthimos can pull off.
"A Jeunet-ian psycho-scape of Victorian puffery twisted inside out, it’s as if the director has scooped out the innards of Mary Shelley and sewed her corpse shut with Terry Gilliam trapped inside"
"As imaginative as the film’s comedy can be, its greatest asset is Emma Stone’s ability to situate Bella Baster first as jester, then as the emotional foundation upon which the whole of Poor Things is built."
"While Poor Things may play to a more general audience than something like Dogtooth, don’t confuse Lanthimos for selling out. It’s all an exploration of the same set of concerns: the dissection of our human behaviors for inspection under an alien lens."
"Like last year's ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" I feel comfortable calling this a lock for Oscar nominations across the board."
"Poor Things is a work about distortion, assemblage, and invention, and thus it’s apt that the film deforms and amalgamates to beget something thrillingly unique."
"Not enough can be said about Stone here. Her incredibly physical performance coupled with pitch-perfect comedic timing and, when Tony McNamara’s brilliant script calls for it, sincerity make it an easy career-best for the starlet. "
"There is a strong creative voice behind the camera from Lanthimos, giving you an incredible cinematic experience you won’t soon forget."
"Lanthimos examines human emotion as a sort of mask that we wear, stripping his characters of time and place to observe the raw human animal. Poor Things might be the purest distillation of this yet."
"It's a remarkable film, shot in Lanthimos's trademark wacky style, with an uproarious performance from Mark Ruffalo as the bounder who tries to exploit Bella's childlike naivety..."
"Bella's journey is a powerfully potent, eye-opening look at the world – sharing honest truths about men and sex, while also allowing Bella to discover and walk down her own path of liberation."
"Poor Things is a film of immense ambition and craft, and one that mostly does what it set out to do, which is to be a vast and riotous psychodrama, whose eccentricity should not impede its popular appeal."
"But rhetorically checkmating keyboard warriors isn’t Poor Things‘ primary agenda, which is issuing a statement against the patriarchy and rape culture (cheers, supportive applause) via Bella’s intellectual and allegorical coming-of-age. "
It's a Luis Buñuel film with the visual sensibility of Terry Gilliam...
"Long live filmmakers who bring us closer to our most savage, vulnerable and luminous essence! [Full review in Spanish]"
"Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos works on a grand scale for the first time in this spectacularly entertaining, visually phenomenal, “Candide”-like feminist fable."
"There is a lot to admire about Poor Things, from the remarkable filmmaking to the crafts to the committed performances by Stone and Ruffalo."
Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver the movies of their lives in this stunning reimagining of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein that is more about life itself than the Victorian/Gothic original
"What remains is a film that, despite the occasional pacing problem, succeeds in placing the viewer before the possibility of something new. [Full review in Spanish]"
Greek weird wave director Yorgos Lanthimos hits his stride with his strangest yet most deeply satisfying comedy fable yet.
"Poor Things itself is an equally – and brilliantly – surprising hybrid: a feminist coming-of-age story, monster movie and bawdy, foul-mouthed sex romp that the Greek alchemist has somehow forged into a masterpiece."
A one of a kind mind-blowing production.
No other mainstream director today is making movies this visually bold and brilliantly realised.
"Perhaps the filmmaker’s most garish and confident endeavor, using Bella’s naive perspective to design a world so heightened that it exists somewhere between a nightmare and a dream. "
"A delightfully unsettling work of absurdism inspired by “Frankenstein,” Poor Things condenses adolescence into a raucous 140-minute package, through an absurd tale of a re-animated woman on a quest of sexual, emotional, and intellectual self-discovery."
"Bella is a cinematic heroine for the ages and Poor Things is a unique piece of artistry. With Yorgos Lanthimos behind the camera, it's not hard to find it fascinating to be alive."
"It’s Lanthimos’ finest movie so far, a strange, gorgeous-looking picture that extends generosity both to its characters and the audience."
"One of the most wildly bizarre cinematic experiences you’re likely to witness... equal parts brilliance and madness. Peculiar, perverse, and preposterous in all the best ways."
"Frequently hilarious, Poor Things is ribald and bawdy."
"This is Lanthimos working on a whole other level, and his finest film to date... made possible by one of the bravest performances ever committed to screen by Emma Stone."
"Together, Lanthimos and his team of players and crew have conjured up a delight that – like its protagonist – is eccentric, smart, a little dark, lovely to look at and charming as hell."
Poor Things is an uproarious and absolutely hilarious look at female self-discovery with career best work from Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos.
"Flamboyant, florid, fantastic, and freakish, this might well be one of the most unique movies you’ll ever see."
"A brilliantly thought-provoking, insanely hilarious story packed with substance, focused on a fascinating self-discovery journey filled with thematically rich layers. Emma Stone is truly impressive."
"The dizzying words would be nothing without Stone, whose explosiveness, attention to detail, and humanization of an otherwise totally outlandish character brings them to life in a fearless, side-splitting, all-consuming performance."
A film which breaks boundaries and subverts our assumptions with as much joy and recklessness as its wide-eyed heroine.
"Sharp, wildly imaginative and jaw-droppingly naughty, the film takes you on a fantastical odyssey of female self-discovery and casually eviscerates the patriarchy in ways Barbie never managed to."
"To this day, How the Grinch Stole Christmas stands as one of the most inspired and truly magical holiday texts."
With a little more polish and a lot more restraint this could have been a holiday treat. Instead it’s a repetitive and sometimes laborious exercise...
"Gaspar Noe by means of Lars von Trier with John Waters, David Lynch, Harmony Korine, Nicolas Winding Refn, Bobcat Goldthwait, Rob Zombie, Darren Aronofsky, Uwe Boll, the Farrellys and Tim Story serving as creative consultants. "
It just doesn't work taking these short Seuss stories and turning them into a feature film. Very unpleasant to watchd
I truly believe that Dr. Seuss defies adaptation and is best left in print and in the imaginations of all who read the stories.
It's just an ugly piece of work.
"Director Ron Howard aims for the beautifully stylized mayhem of Frank Tashlin and Tim Burton, but he comes closer to the clamorous, headache-inducing visual overkill of Joel Schumacher's Batman movies."
"It's sweet enough for the very young, edgy enough for teens, and world/pop culture savvy enough for adults."
The film is an act of love that doesn't quite transmit all of the passion it wishes it could. [Full Review in Spanish]
A forgettable film in Ron Howard's repertoire. [Full Review in Spanish]
"I just can't imagine the editor and director sitting down together, and THIS being the final product."
"They really didn't have solid direction, they were just doing too much. That's coming from me, someone who routinely does too much."
"Director Ron Howard usually lets his comedies gestate organically, but his Grinch is frantic from start to finish."
"A fundamentally soulless, mercenary attack on soulless, mercenary things, and this ends up being deeply tedious and tiresome to watch, on pretty much every possible level."
"The director, Ron Howard, is a grand old heartwarmer (Cocoon, etc.) but the heart of this picture is dead."
"Such a departure from the book, it's not even Dr. Seuss."
"Live-action version of classic has some crude, scary moments."
"An unforgivable transgression from the usually reliable Ron Howard, ""Grinch"" boasts the visual polish of a Menards tree aisle and resembles not a cheerful Christmas, but rather what the bloodcurdling onset of a mescaline bender might feel like."
"Howard and the rest of the crew do something the late Dr. Seuss never would: take chronological age over the youthful, innocent spirit that lingers untouched in everyone--and never goes out of style."
"Five-year-olds might go for it, but people who grew up with Jones' version will be looking at their watches and grinding their teeth."
"Cloying fancy gives way to gross-out comedy, twisted social commentary, affecting pathos, and weirdly sexualized romance in this lurid live-action version of the classic children's book."
Parents can relax: Ron Howard's version of Dr. Seuss' tale of the Christmas-napping Grinch is a smartly stylized hoot.
"Shrill, strenuous and entirely without charm."
"The costumes astound, the sight gags abound, but the heart, oh the heart, now that must be found."
"A jumbled mess, art-directed to within an inch of its life."
"Unfortunately, Ron Howard is the Grinch who stole Christmas from Jim Carrey, Dr. Seuss, and the children who deserve a better story."
""
"A holiday gift, The Grinch just may steal the hearts of kids and grown-ups alike."
"Universal Pictures has definitely left something under your Christmas tree, but you might want to clean it up soon before it leaves a permanent stain."
"In adding material, The Grinch loses much of its rhythm and the heart within it shrinks three sizes right along with it."
How the Grinch Stole Christmas is thick with irony but doesn't have the guts to explore any of it.
"If God is in the details, then this is the most righteous movie ever made.Jim Carrey is the only man deserving to interpret Chuck Jones' animation."
"It's funny, it's sincere and it's gloriously bizarre."
This delightful fantasy offers Happy Who-lidays to the young and the young at heart.
"Carrey is superb, swamped in makeup and sounding like a cross between Hitchcock and The Honey Monster."
Howard and his writers have made some interesting choices in bringing one of the most well-known American Christmas cartoons to life on the big screen.
"The story’s message has always been that Christmas isn’t about baubles and trinkets or Santa and trees, it’s about celebration and joy. The problem is that the film collapses under the sheer weight of Carrey’s performance and the additional story elements"
"Colourful adaptation of the children's classic by Dr Seuss, redeemed by a combination of Jim Carrey's manic performance, the sets and the make-up."
You may feel like he stole 2 hours instead of Xmas and you'll want them back.
Director Ron Howard's movie version of the popular Dr. Seuss classic creates a world of wonder and enchantment for kids of all ages. I found myself captivated by everything about it.
"A shockingly noisy, ugly film."
"""We'll slow down the pace and add flashback scenes, ""To the time when the Grinch was less furry, less green. ""We'll beef up the part of little Cindy Lou Who, ""Throw in lots of slapstick and sentiment, too."
So the true meaning of Christmas and the simplicity of Dr. Seuss' classic holiday message were exploited by the crass commericialism of Universal Pictures. Did we really expect anything different?
By the time that you read this short essay of ours / The Grinch will have made ten squintillion more dollars!
How the Grinch stole Christmas is one kind of larceny. How Jim Carrey steals the picture is another matter entirely.
"Other than some pretty good set design and special effects, there was nothing new of value in this version."
"Definitely worth adding to the Christmas movie pantheon, but not at the expense of the original."
Watching it approaches the disturbing position of being bedside as a loved one expires from a terminal disease.
"We should probably be grateful that The Grinch is merely flawed and mediocre, not the flat-out disaster it could have been."
Truly crowd pleasin' and Carrey's the reason.
Perhaps 20 minutes too long and subject to torpor.
"Less entertaining, less enlightening and less educational than either the book or the video."
"This very funny, visually stunning film is a delight from start to finish."
Howard has certainly nailed the playfully eccentric other world of Whoville.
"For tales that require some edge, it is safe to deduce that Ron Howard is no match for the great Dr. Seuss."
"The movie feels like it is perpetually in conflict, torn between its desire to be both a light-hearted fable and a dark black comedy."
...severely (and unwittingly) alters the very source material beyond a point of explanation.
One of the ugliest movies ever perpetrated on a mass audience.
"A movie with good set and costume design, and very little else."
Should be more heartfelt and touching than it is.
"Anthony Hopkins was chosen to narrate the film, perhaps to recall the English accent of Boris Karloff from the vastly superior original animation, a move the filmmakers should have avoided."
It is impossible to watch Grinch and not think wistfully of that magical moment in the TV special.
A wonderfully funny movie with all the best that Jim Carrey has to give.
"It's the rare holiday movie that manages to entertain the kid in all of us, without forgetting that grownups love the Grinch, too."
"Carrey, with another ground-breaking performance, single-handedly elevates it to something much better."
Generally delightful live-action adaptation of the children's classic.
Every Who down in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot. But Director Ron Who-ward saw gold in a pot.
[It] could have certainly benefited from a little more of that mischievous nature.
"Shows respect for the words and images of the book, and the wonderful 1966 animated classic."
"If you have little moviegoers around for the holidays, you should still make the trip to Whovillie."
"It's Christmas, for Grinch's sake; better to overdo it than be sacrilegious and not."
Sure to earn a berth among the perennial Christmas film classics.
Any tale that critiques the over-the-top commercialism of our society is right on track.
"Grinchy-poo, you used to be a mean one... now you're just a goof. Sigh."
The movie seems content to operate without a soul.
What they forgot to budget for was heart.
This Grinch isn't so bad. It's quite merry. Very!
"Believe it or not, the Critic loved The Grinch!"
You won't need a heart two sizes too small to gnash your teeth at this Grinch.
The problems with Grinch stem from the lackluster script.
How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a holiday winner.
It is closer to wonderful than it is to awful.
Howard and company actually make the collision of Seuss' sing-song poetry and Carrey's smart-aleck asides and sniggering sense of humor work.
"Actually pretty entertaining, even for grown-ups, once you get through the first 10."
A cute and funny movie in its own right.
A true timeless classic this film may not be; It's simply a package of holiday glee.
It's not Christmas that's being stolen here. It's the spirit of Dr. Seuss.
You've got a stinker that deserves to be locked away in the yuletide bomb shelter along with Scrooged and Santa Claus: The Movie.
The main show here is Jim Carrey. And he does a frankly brilliant job.
The result is a vulnerable and sympathetic performance that may be Carrey's best to date.
Boasts comic punch.
Michael Corenblith's busy production design provides plenty to look at.
"At its center, it has Carrey, whose nasty, catty Grinch is a hoot and a half."
So that is how a Grinch and a girl steal this movie -- through heart and emotion. And aren't we glad they did.
"Se compone bastante y puede llegar a ser conmovedora, pero el inicio no le ayuda"
"In reviewing this movie it all comes down to one thing: When the credits rolled, I had a big smile on my face."
An adaptation of a Ronald Dahl story about changing your life and doing the impossible.
"Sugar embarks on a wonderful adventure, traveling the world, using his abilities for the benefit of others, not for himself. This is the kind of movie we need right now, in world where destructive selfishness and xenophobia are running rampant."
...a wittily verbose master class on the way voice can be employed in fiction.
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is a fascinating experiment in narration and storytelling.
The story-telling here is beautiful. 
The longest of [Anderson's Dahl shorts] collection is also by far its richest.
"Wes Anderson's inventive, precisely calibrated cinematic contrivance works - making this enigmatic anthology enchanting viewing."
"The result is exhilarating to watch, with Anderson's witty filmmaking sitting perfectly alongside Dahl's darkly provocative narratives."
"It’s thrilling to be distracted by really good storytelling. But it’s more thrilling to be provoked, or even altered by it."
I think this is the just the right bite-size amount of Wes Anderson... I kind of feel like shorts are an excellent use of his his style [and] his voice.
Anderson seems to have perfected the art of simultaneously showing and telling – a tinkertoy approach to cinema that can pall over the length of a feature but plays with delightful brio in a short.
A confounding mix of admirable skill and disconcerting ideas carries over from author Roald Dahl’s short stories into a series of mini films directed by Wes Anderson.
As charming and heartfelt as any film Anderson has made. 
"Taken as a whole, and the four films should be watched together, it's a deeply significant work for Anderson, and one of the year's best movies, no matter how you parse it."
"I promise not to review the rest of Wes Anderson’s Roald Dahl adaptations when they come out. I can see them already without the use of my eyes, just like Imdad Khan in The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar."
"Once more, Wes made me cry with the beauty and sweetness of it all."
"Wes Anderson and Roald Dahl. What a brilliant, eccentric, complicated relationship that is."
"If Dahl's original work offered a peek into the writing process, Anderson's retelling does the same for the staging process."
"It's yet another sign that Anderson is only getting weirder, and more wondrous, the further he plunges into middle age."
"Watching Henry Sugar, perhaps more so than any other film I’ve seen, gives the sensation of being read a great picture-book -- albeit one that is fully alive, cinematic, and age-agnostic."
"Dahl and Anderson are kindred spirits in whimsy, fully simpatico."
"Roald Dahl’s work has always been a salve to children in need, acknowledging the cruelty of the wider world and celebrating inventive defiance. With these short films Wes Anderson shows how that still matters."
There’s such a wonky harmony between Dahl’s words and Anderson’s profoundly unique style which makes this quirky short film such a delight.
Anderson has said it was the story’s nesting-doll structure that drew him to Henry Sugar in the first place... and he realizes its concentric narratives with dazzling fluidity.
"A short film with the weight and breadth of an epic, traversing continents and time periods while remaining stock still."
"Those who eagerly await the newest American Empirical Picture will be entranced, as usual, by the toybox sets and the people standing stock still like toy figures inside immaculate compositions."
"Lest viewers become even briefly comfortable with the enchantments of his staging and of his actors’ performances, Anderson jolts them alert with ever more audacious contrivances."
"... With Wes Anderson's perspective, this story becomes a small visual epic. [Full review in Spanish]"
"This is an archetypal Anderson film: mannered, fussy, obsessively designed – normally irksome traits, but in this alchemic instance it’s an utterly delightful combination."
The reunion of Dahl’s writing and Anderson’s filmmaking for the first time since Fantastic Mr. Fox yields similarly wonderful results.
Wes Anderson's most enjoyable work since The Grand Budapest Hotel
The imaginative world of Anderson's cinematic universe can never replicated. His work evokes a poise and elegant feeling that is impossible to imitate.
"A perfect mix of the different quirkiness of Roald Dahl and Wes Anderson, this is as relevant today as it ever was."
"Anderson pulls this lever of speed, of artifice, so hard, he breaks it..."
A great reminder of the power of short form film.
"It’s not among Dahl’s greatest hits or Anderson’s grand meringue delights, but “Henry Sugar” amuses here and there and passes by quickly, unlike the interminable “Asteroid City” and sometimes strained earlier Anderson outings. "
"As a main course, The Wonderful Story Of Henry Sugar probably wouldn’t be very satisfying, but as a light and airy dessert, it really hits the spot."
"It’s a story about greed and altruism, an homage to Satyajit Ray, and the closest Wes Anderson will probably ever come to directing a superhero hero movie."
"It employs no fewer than four narrators across a span of more than six decades, all in service of a deftly multi-threaded yarn that has the elegance and concision of a well-executed magic trick."
"Anderson takes 40 minutes to tell the story of a debonair trickster in his flamboyant style, but I'm sometimes struck by the feeling that there's not much substance behind Benedict Cumberbatch's stage. [Full review in Spanish]"
Anderson enhances Dahl’s parable in endearing and meaningful ways.
"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is, by all reckoning, a magnificent adaptation of an outstanding story."
"The movie whips past in a moment, a result of the combined pace of the dialogue and sets that shift and morph endlessly; it's like trying to keep up with a speeding hare on your hands and feet."
"There’s no illusion of reality here, no detachment from the storyteller and the story. In every single moment of The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, we are reminded that this is a product of human imagination, brought into being by human hands. "
"You can barely call it a movie. You can, however, recognize it as one of Wes Anderson‘s best attempts at transforming both his and his literary idol’s idiosyncrasies into something like art -- and the most satisfying posthumous double act in ages."
"The story is oddball charming and even has a nifty moral to it. And the presentational style is, well, beautiful."
"Beautiful and poignant, this is such a brilliant way to bring these short stories to life."
"Where blockbusters spend millions on digital de-ageing, Kingsley swaps wigs on-camera."
"Rarely does it feel like there is a second wasted, and while this may be a short film, it is still dripping with rich detail that shows the prowess of Dahl as a storyteller and Anderson as a director, a match made in cinematic heaven "
"Henry Sugar shows a filmmaker at the height of his powers, using his finely honed skills and keen self-awareness to perfectly capture Dahl’s whimsical spirit."
"A choreographed dance of an experience — one that could have easily felt like a run-on sentence, but instead flies by. "
"Ultimately, the mix of marquee names, relatively bite-sized format and Netflix as a platform feels like an ideal marriage of talent, material and distribution -- a better combination, frankly, than Anderson's last few movies."
"The story itself might be a short, but the initiative within this tale is anything but."
"As a story, Roald Dahl’s The Wonderful Life of Henry Sugar might not be everyone’s cup of tea—it’s certainly not mine. But as a Wes Anderson short film, it is another delightful splendor with a fantastic cast bringing their whimsical A-game."
"... With the charming The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, the director of The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) returns to his best form. [Full review in Spanish]"
Wes Anderson’s latest Roald Dahl adaptation The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar plays out like the most elaborately orchestrated and exquisitely executed episode of Jackanory every devised.
"This short film doubles down on just about every peculiar element Anderson is known for and packs it into a relatively short runtime. The dialog is smartly written and exceptionally delivered, creating a measured beat that could be timed with a metronome."
"Anderson’s decision-making is on point, as this story is told without much filler. Not one moment feels unnecessary. Every character serves a purpose, and the production design is outstanding."
"A children’s tale and a trifle, but Anderson has found a way to deliver a sophisticated, self-assured, and endlessly charming adaptation that would make Imdad Khan proud — even if he was blindfolded in the back row."
"As Anderson says, it's about the telling of the story as much as it is about the story itself.
"
"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar crafts a truly unique experience that is well worth investing the 39 minutes it takes to watch.

"
[The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is] constantly witty and hilariously deadpan.
"In Henry Sugar, Anderson creates a storybook set in motion—where the sets fly and the characters transform with the same playfulness as our parents switching voices during bedtime stories.
"
"This film is intriguing, even exhilarating, in its way, and maybe no other director could have represented the material as well..."
"Visually pleasing, entertaining, and a whole lot of fun. Making it a short rather than a feature was a brilliant decision because it helps with pacing and allows it to be interesting the whole way through. "
"Less (time, in this case) is more. And The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is the best out of the last three films by our dear Wes Anderson. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A delightful first instalment in a planned quartet of short films, Anderson and Dahl’s sensibilities continuing to be a match made in heaven."
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is filled with non-stop narration with layers of decadent dioramas that suit Wes Anderson’s quirks making it a warm welcome back to the director.
"Like in Asteroid City, and in other Anderson films, it's the clear proof and pursuit of that creation that brings truth to spectacle. And what gorgeous truths and spectacles lie in wait in The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar."
"A beautiful and bountiful bite-size film, it stands as Anderson’s second triumph of 2023 (following June’s Asteroid City) and a mini-masterwork in its own right."
"This might not be as flat-out unmissable as Asteroid City, but it’s a charming addition to Anderson’s filmography that serves as a promising appetiser for the Dahl adaptations to come."
Henry Sugar's The Wonderful Story tells the story of a man who managed to see without using his eyes. [Full review in Spanish] 
"Anderson grants his audience a sense of cosy complicity via fourth-wall-breaking asides, but there’s not much to get purchase on in a thinly-sketched morality tale. "
"It’s a short film, but its portrayal of inspiration, self-evident in both its artistry and homage, is simply enormous."
"The result is delightful, but it also suggests a universe that requires our own imagination to be fully realized — which is, of course, the whole point of the story."
"The book, of course, is one of the sweetest Dahls written (see Henry’s surname). And it’s now become a perfectly precise blast of finest Anderson."
" In a work suffused with stupefying mysteries, the strange visions Henry Sugar teems with echo its drifters’ wide-eyed wonder as well as their creator’s. It’s an infectious feeling."
"Form underscores content in ""Henry Sugar"" in a most delightful way."
Wes Anderson and Roald Dahl is one of cinema’s most well-matched marriages and this one is a whimsically wonderful anthology.
"[Richard] Ayoade is probably the strongest of the new entrants to Anderson’s ensemble, hiding seamlessly behind disguises in multiple roles and grasping the silent-era style of Anderson’s favored physical comedy."
Having a limit on the runtime allows Anderson to challenge himself and focus on making the most charming and slender movie possible.
"Against the odds, Anderson has turned out to be perhaps the greatest interpreter of Dahl we have."
"For devotees, it's a delightful little morsel, lovingly brought to life as only Anderson knows how."
"Whimsy with a capital W that unleashes Anderson’s arsenal of quirks. Truly marvellous medicine for fans, but could be a broken record for those who aren’t."
"Wonderful by name, wonderful by nature. Wes Anderson's 39-minute adaptation of Roald Dahl's homonymous story is a truly gorgeous creation."
Yet another vital chapter in the filmmaker’s career-long obsession with self-understanding in a senseless world.
Small but perfectly crafted.
"The result is funny and charming, a short but entirely satisfying confection."
The “Fantastic Mr. Fox” author’s “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar” seems to have found its ideal screen incarnation in the “Fantastic Mr. Fox” director’s hands...
"If Asteroid City was writer-director Wes Anderson’s love letter to the stage, his new Netflix short pays homage to stagecraft, with flats, backdrops, props, and even hair and makeup changes flying in from the wings."
"This returned the franchise to the high spot that the original sat on after its release. Credit Fuqua with being a director who, like Mr. Tony Scott, is able to pull different shades of Denzel out of the hat for a crowd without sacrificing his essence."
"This may be a lone-gun western in modern clothes, but franchise director Antoine Fuqua delivers plenty of tense, no-nonsense stand-offs and staccato bursts of mayhem. "
A definite improvement over the previous picture.
"Equalizer 3 is the fifth collaboration between Fuqua and Washington, and the results are pretty similar to their other films."
"The Equalizer 3 is not a franchise limping to its final act. If anything, the third installment of the series makes a very strong case for at least one more chapter."
"It would be highly unfair to evaluate 'The Equalizer 3' in terms of whether it's better or worse than the two preceding titles, It's more appropriate to label it as a complementary and equally satisfying bet that shares the foundation of its genetic code."
"Fuqua and Washington prefer that McCall be feared as a vigilante. They seem uninterested in the mechanics of the spy world and the elegance of the first television series. In their three “Equalizer” films, the specter of violence is what thrills them."
"Although the film does not assume the conventions of an action film, the dramatic pulse is fueled by Washington and his interactions with the rest of the cast. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Fuqua directs with style, taking his time, developing a palpable atmosphere of tension, and even including some religious imagery, as if to give an additional symbolic dimension to the story. And Washington, as always, shines. Full review in Spanish."
A tremendously fun action movie. [Full review in Spanish]
Fuqua and Washington put a bloody bow on one of our best and most underrated action franchises. [Full Review in Spanish]
"... Equally tense and predictable, but dominated by the incomparable presence of its protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Does it entertain? Yes, until it tires you out. [Full review in Spanish]"
"In the hands of another team and starring another actor, Equalizer 3 would be a generic revenge film. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Like Liam Neeson, Denzel Washington doesn't seem to get any older as an action hero... [Full review in Spanish]"
 Antoine Fuqua’s direction gives the film momentum.
"If it's not broke, then don't fix it. They haven't fixed it in 40 years, and they didn't fix it in this movie, either. "
"You watch these movies for the same rush you get from a superhero film, except Denzel is not a superhero and he doesn't need to be. That makes it so much better -- he's flesh and blood. "
“The Equalizer” films have always been junk; they’re based on a mid-1980s TV show that was no great shakes to begin with. What did Washington ever see in them?
"For those that have enjoyed McCall’s violently cathartic journey, The Equalizer 3 is here to please"
"A straightforward tale of good guys versus bad guys, all centred on the presence of Washington"
"Despite the film’s virtues, the formula it follows is simple, and simplistic: Bad guys do really bad things to good people; hero does really bad things to bad guys. The end."
"Based on a long-running television series, “The Equalizer” franchise doesn’t expand much, either. Unlike “Mission: Impossible,” it settles for a blue-chip star and a well-worn premise."
Washington and Fuqua give audiences what they want and need with some action sequences that will ring in your brain for days.  Denzel is back baby!
"The saving grace is Fuqua's portrait of Italy, which glows with an ethereal warmth. You can tell he has a real fondness for these people, their culture, their joy and the cobblestone streets which they call home. "
…the change to a more exotic setting and the scalding photography of Robert Richardson elevate The Equaliser 3 to the best of a series that always had high professional standards…
"I'd like to see The Equalizer have one last cameo in another hitman franchise link-up, go out in a blaze of vigilante glory, and be put out to pasture permanently. Still good, but getting tired."
"You have to expect a lot of violence in a movie like this, but the overly graphic way the violence is presented did put me off a bit, even so. Still, it is a good, solid action movie, and a worthy sequel."
"It feels like a horror film; like you're watching Jason or Michael Myers, except Denzel is the boogeyman in this case... and that smile that he has at the very beginning, that's his mask."
"If you've glossed over the stellar first feature and therefore missed the sequel, but are now intrigued by the release of a third in an unprecedented Denzel Washington franchise - Equalizer 3 is the reason to catch up."
"Are you sitting down? Because Denzel Washington sure is in what amounts to a well-shot, on-location version of those sad DTV movies where Steven Seagal largely confines himself to a chair."
...agreeably familiar subject matter that’s employed to erratic yet watchable effect by Fuqua...
"Michael Myers (as in the slasher, and not the comedian) ain’t got nothing on Robert McCall, Washington’s widower, veteran, retired intelligence operative and self-appointed lone protector of everyday people"
"While some action directors may be content with capturing edgy, dimly lit imagery to cover their cinematic mayhem, three time Oscar-winner Richardson was given reign to go further. "
"That’s enough equalizing now, thank you very much."
It's very grim and incredibly bloody with no real surprises - I'm sure you can guess how it ends - but since Denzel is one of the best - he elevates the material in a way that only he can by lighting up the screen.
"Aided by Fuqua’s slick production, [Washington] he’s an old school movie star still very much in his prime, killing it (and everyone else) for our trashy viewing pleasure."
"A particular franchise favorite is slamming a head into a glass table so that the camera can shoot the sickening thunk from below. If that sounds like your kind of thing, stop reading this and buy a ticket."
Denzel seems to be sleepwalking through every scene that doesn’t involve gouging and/or stabbing.
Denzel Washington caps off his vigilantism in an Italian town with equal gore & gravitas. There’s a quiet dignity to him whether he’s brandishing violence or benevolence.
" Assuming this is the last ride for the Equalizer series, they went out on top, and there couldn’t be a better time for it at the theatre."
"Whether enjoying a cappuccino, flirting with a waitress or snapping men’s forearms, Washington makes it all seem like a movie star enjoying a midlife dolce vita moment."
"Even though this looks as it will be the last of The Equalizers we will see for the time being, it is clearly the best of them."
"The Equalizer 3 marks a fitting and warm end to the franchise. It offers all the audacious violence and familiar set-pieces of the previous films, paired with a wistful goodbye to its central vigilante."
And incredible on-screen reunion for Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning 19 years later after Man on Fire. My favorite Equalizer film yet!
"Without any moral foundation, this action-movie sequel gives its protagonist (and its audience) the same license to enjoy killing as reckless horror-film sensationalism does."
"A film where a talented director and superstar actor are simply going through the motions, lending an undertone of apathy that’s impossible to overcome. "
"Clearly Fuqua, the producers and production team are hoping viewers like their attention to aesthetics. Their dream may come true."
"The series’ third installment benefits from a fish-out-of-water story and the gravitas of its star, eventually making The Equalizer 3 the most entertaining entry."
"This is a very intense, it is violent, but a good action flick. Denzel Washington is phenomenal in everything he does and this is another example of why he's one our best actors today. "
"Finally, on the series’ supposedly last outing, one of its films lives up to the ever-deepening talent of its leading man."
You know what you're getting from 'The Equalizer 3' and it's pointless expecting any more from it. It's not trying to be anything other than something that's made by talented craftspeople to do nothing other than boil the pot.
"The Equalizer 3 is precisely the film one would expect it to be (if a little more bloated in places than it requires) and if it is indeed the end of the series, the film is its high point."
We shift pace in the last offering of Mr McCall and the lovable friends he meets along the way. Charming remnants of what made this franchise so much fun.
"Equalizer 3 scales new heights in grandeur, overshadowing its predecessors. With Washington and Fanning's nostalgic reunion against Italy's backdrop, it's a cinematic feast, albeit not without its familiar flavors."
"This is a great hour and 49 minutes of action film, and I wholeheartedly recommend it."
"At its best – and The Equalizer 3 is about as good as the first film -- it neatly counterbalances Fuqua’s baroque, blood-and-guts action with Washington’s ability to command attention while sitting perfectly still."
"The movie is bloody and never boring, the featuring dazzling oceanfront locations, textured cinematography, and a heartwarming message about finding community. "
"The action scenes are horribly ­entertaining, but McCall is just as deadly with a withering smile."
"The Equalizer 3 is simply a more stylish repeat of the following pattern: He came, he killed, he kept on going.

"
"This nearly decade long franchise manages to go out with style, gravitas, and a few surprises. "
"This is being called the final chapter for this brutal vigilante hero, and Denzel Washington is back to give the movie some superb gravitas and just a hint of morality."
"Unfortunately, the third Equalizer movie is the weakest in the series. The Equalizer 3 is yet another example of diminishing returns."
"Ultimately this third entry leaves off on a vaguely dissatisfying note, as if the series went one sequel too far."
"It’s a step up from the messy plot of the 2018 sequel, but this movie swings too far the other way."
"McCall’s third outing is bloody, brutally efficient and oh-so-beautiful!"
Fuqua & Denzel are on vacation and the latter seems completely checked out emotionally and often physically as the shockingly brutal action is far between usually showing only the aftermath and inserts of the actor's footsteps.
The European style of filmmaking that Fuqua adopts with this film makes it the best in the trilogy.
"I like my implausible stories to be more plausible, and for me to be more emotionally involved."
It's good entertainment that's slightly lifted above average because Denzel Washington is such a brilliant actor.
"While there are no surprises here, there are visceral kicks to be found in the businesslike efficiency of McCall’s retribution, and the devilish glint in Washington’s eye as he delivers it."
"While this outing is as gory as its predecessors -- a bloody, bone-crunching, axe-to-the-head tale of right over wrong -- it’s tempered by a high regard for craft and a reluctance to rush. The pace suits Washington."
The best in the series.
"...makes no sense...old, overweight Washington unbelievable as a man of action...the denouement is so utterly absurd that what came before just validates the idea that Fuqua really didn’t have any idea where to go with this, so he just winged it."
"Everybody likes to see Denzel give the bad guys a beat down, and that's what you'll find."
"This ultraviolent third installment in the vigilante action franchise finds Washington back in top form. However, changing the setting and rearranging the narrative puzzle pieces isn’t enough to freshen a well-worn concept."
"The Equalizer 3 is the messiest of the three movies and the most narratively fractured, but it should still satisfy those who consider themselves to be fans."
Surprisingly poignant and resonant.
"There's still stuff I liked in this one, but I was kind of disappointed."
"Grim and violent, this franchise still has some blood in its veins, even if it does get a bit cartoony at times."
McCall came across as a tightly wound spring inside a tranquil shell. He was more often on defense than offense and this time it is reversed. It makes for an acceptable action film but doesn’t have the same crispness as the previous [films].
Fuqua is able to focus on what makes these movies weirdly delightful: Watching the very strange yet endearing character of Robert McCall... charming the innocent while striking fear into the hearts of those who should fear righteous justice.
There is some snappy dialogue and comebacks in this film... It's every bit as entertaining to watch as the action.
"Given the simplicity of the basic template, Fuqua and Wenk cleverly weave together the various strands. The effect provides the movie with more emotional resonance, even if the overarching threat and big crime boss are almost wholly generic."
"After three entries of variable quality and varying body counts, the Equalizer series has settled into comfortable familiarity with Washington holding the center with a mix of irony-free gravitas and movie-star charisma."
"""The Threequalizer"" is easily the best entry in the series, and Washington's best work in the action space in more than a decade. Consider it a relaxing vacation with a side order of violence."
"A brutally efficient addition to the Equalizer franchise. The villains are a bit overly generic and action scenes are not as articulate but the heart of the story, the beautiful Italian setting, and the delivery of Denzel's Robert McCall make up for it."
"With a sluggish storyline, peculiar plot holes and villains who turn from callously cruel to child-like within seconds, this is a film with many problems."
"The Equalizer 3 is a near-lifeless chapter in this series that will only be remembered for how one of our greatest living actors can elevate tedious material through his reliable acting craft and magnetic presence

"A pure slice of exploitive pulp that isn’t afraid of offering audiences a little fan service in the name of a good, sleazy time."
"At one point, Fanning attempts to spy on Robert, sneaking a photo while he sits sipping espresso. He turns, offering a big irresistible smile for the camera. The whole film is that pose, be it while holding a wine glass or a derrière-destroying shotgun."
"Washington is terrifically charismatic as the methodical killing machine, adding a spark of understated delight to McCall's metamorphosis. There's a new sense of ease heretofore missing from a character who, while always calm, was also always on guard. "
I feel bad for the people who will go see The Equalizer 3 thinking it’s going to be an action movie.
"The overarching plot of the film is pretty boilerplate, but the fine details count for a lot."
“The Equalizer 3” is hot garbage. It’s also a fascinating but failed attempt by Fuqua and Washington to make their own Mann-Stewart film.
"Denzel Washington’s threequelizer is an all-you-can-stomach buffet of violent delights and ends, and an affectionate goodbye to a modern B-movie legend."
"Washington is as convincing as ever, showing a fierce (and often frightening) intensity in the action scenes and a genuine warmth and humanity in others."
"It delivers the goods, thanks to Washington’s performance and Fuqua’s zest for going graphic."
"The Equalizer 3 itself, unfortunately, doesn't come close to matching the impact of Washington's presence."
"The Equalizer 3 asks of McCall whether he can ever really find peace. It asks us, the viewer, a slightly different question: Do we even really want him to?"
"... easily the most visceral and the most intelligent action film of year. Decades in the making, there's nothing else like this out there."
"Surpassing expectations and delivering a heaping dose of electrifying visuals, Mad Max: Fury Road is what all blockbuster action movies should strive to be."
The entire movie takes place over one absolutely bonkers chase sequence. Its cinematic stats are jaw-dropping...
"What follows is not quite as routinely life-threatening, but it’s still incredibly physical filmmaking. $150 million, it seems, will buy you the budget to stand in the desert and sling a camera around..."
This is pure action cinema – a beautiful mixture of old-school style and modern movie technology.
"The viewer becomes swept up in the forward-moving narrative impetus, thrilled to audible gasps by Miller’s wonderfully excessive parade of stunts and effects, each more impressive and more fantastically outlandish than the last."
"It is the rare, beautiful film that can take even the most staunch of cinephiles and reduce them to a giddy child, flush with excitement and rooting for the heroes to win."
"Mad Max: Fury Road is a slobbernocking achievement that also happens to be a singular experience, best seen on the most gargantuan screen possible with friends, soda, candy and a jaw that can be dropped at will."
"The definition of a wholly unapologetically action-packed film, Mad Max: Fury Road breathes new life into an old series..."
"It's hard to see another movie equalling this one's grand ambition, deep ideas and awe-inspiring action."
"In a film with such a strong female lead, how could George Miller write such thoroughly forgettable supporting characters?... [Also] how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?!"
"Charlize Theron delivers a captivating, challenging performance as Furiosa, arguably her best since Monster."
Other favorite moments include finding which men could not keep a beat in any scene with drums.
Holy cow I loved this movie.
I had my palm raised to the universe the second [Charlize Theron's Furiosa] took control of that big rig and led the charge across the desert.
"The film offers extremely satisfying set pieces and action, plus ultimately some reveals that change how we previously understood our main character."
"You'll have to watch it to see how it took us to new heights of energetic, ambitious, emotionally resonant, intelligent, exhilarating, and political filmmaking."
"On top of all the crazy good stuff, there are a bandit of kick ass grannies living in the desert! (I mean, Miller must be channeling some Ursula K. Le Guin fan fiction here, jesus christ) And it works! Miraculously!"
Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie with the kind of reach most people - and even most movies - can only aspire to.
Less a remake and more a reinvention of Miller's own postapocalyptic action movie genre.
"Although it's cold, violent and visceral you can also feel the underlying elements of hope, loyalty, reverence and redemption."
Fury Road is a masterpiece of mayhem which cemented Charlize Theron as one of the greatest modern action stars and there's no experience quite like it.
"This is exactly the type of grand cinematic spectacle brimming with passionate, zealous ideas that's been sorely lacking from the mechanical operations of formulaic tent poles."
Films like Mad Max: Fury Road do not come along often. Director George Miller delivers an epic and visual cinema art film that celebrates survival and hope in a bleak and deranged universe.
"Wall-to-wall visceral action, insane practical stunts, highly stylized production, with a thoughtful take on the apocalypse."
"Fury Road is the literal definition of controlled chaos. It's an amazing, full-tilt assault on the senses ... the most brilliant piece of mayhem to ever hit the screen."
"In addition to being furiously entertaining and having new protagonists, watching this blockbuster is like going to the desert to see a special show by Monster truck, Slipknot and Cirque du Soleil. [Full review in Spanish]"
This movie was just bonkers.
"It was great. I mean, this is how to do an action movie."
"Mad Max: Fury Road will be the film to beat for a long time coming, and the new high-water mark against which to judge action and blockbuster filmmaking. This is, quite simply, how it's done."
"It's a rare film that engages the mind while rocking the body. Miller's vision of a world consumed by its own greed, where water, gasoline, and bullets are the most precious commodities, seems even more relevant today than it did 30 years ago."
As close to riding a rollercoaster you can experience while sitting in a movie theater.
The entirety is a delicious assault on both your visual cortex and auditory system - a giant orchestral blend of machine engines roaring and wheels peeling combined with a booming overture of drums and guitar.
"Furiosa and the women are the heart and soul of Fury Road, championing female life and autonomy into something that could have easily been a popcorn flick for bros."
"Arty, gorgeous, exciting, compelling, and poignant all at once."
"It's something awesome. It's all hot orange and brown, the glamour of the punishing desert wind, it is completely OTT and it can't go five minutes without an explosion and I loved it."
"Miller's magnum opus is proof a film can be fueled by meaningful social subtext and still kick ass. It's evidence that all-out action need not be reduced to ""dumb fun."" It's brilliant. It's glorious. It is Maxcellent."
"Fury Road seems aimed at dudes who fetishize chrome and steel, but Miller plants seeds of bolder, more incendiary ideas within the bro-fantasy."
"The sheer sustained energy of this thing is breathtaking, and Miller's singular vision is a thing of brutal beauty."
"Action films with a simple, one-track mindset can be far from a bad thing, but Fury Road never successfully establishes any stakes."
"Theron's thunderous performance leads the charge, in this film that steals your breath and boils your blood. What the cast and crew have achieved is rare and precious. Cherish it."
The stunt work is flawless.
"My review could consist of me pointing at the screen for 2 hours and going, ""AAAAAAAAARRRRRGGGHHHHHTHISISAMAAAAAAZZZIIINNNG!"""
"The budget and the actors may have changed, but this is clearly the evolution of the filmmaker's crazed vision, arguably reaching the petrol-soaked Valhalla that he's been striving for since the modest thrills of 1979's Mad Max."
"In Mad Max: Fury Road, the ""strong female characters"" are notable specifically for their aversion to violence."
"Among its many strong points, Mad Max: Fury Road manages to develop its characters as well as introduce different story arcs at a very fast pace."
Mad Max: Fury Road has it all.
"If there is any justice, Fury Road will act as a portend not for the demise of our culture, but rather as a shining example of what vibrant, mega-blockbusters can be."
"Perhaps the best female heroine in an action film since Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in the ""Aliens"" franchise. The action makes ""Fury Road"" memorable, but Theron makes it unforgettable."
"""Max"" means the ultimate, the limit, the intensity, the most. Mad Max: Fury Road certainly lives up to his name."
George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road is spectacular - a cacophony of automotive carnage unlike anything that has ever graced the big screen.
A welcome return by George Miller to the kind of anarchic action he hasn't directed in the three decades since Thunderdome.
"It's like an insane 80's B-movie, but one made with thought, effort, and enough of a budget to match its deranged aspirations."
"Like a sublime dieselpunk opera scored for blood, fire, guns and accompanied by an orchestra of insanely tricked-out vehicles."
"The best action movie I have seen so far this year, and I doubt anything else coming out will be able to top it."
A thriller whose intensity is driven by emotion as much as it is by motion.
"Miller adorns every scene with the most astonishing, peculiar imagery and the vehicular action is like nothing you've ever seen."
"t's by no means a perfect film, but it's an action movie with a heart and a mind, built to do much more than just make you feel as if you've endured a visual pummeling."
"The thumping drums and booms amp up the film on a whole other level, something I haven't felt since Interstellar. The way the different music was used to signify the arrival of another War Party was a sonic experience I need to see more of."
"""Mad Max Fury Road"" is one of the worst and meaningless movies I have ever seen."
"It's fine B-grade mulch, but it's certainly no masterpiece...it's surprising, and a tad disheartening, how readily Fury Road falls into line with so many other production-line blockbusters."
"This is one of the few movies I've ever seen where the whole audience broke into spontaneous, loud applause a third of the way in."
The entire cast seems handpicked for a kind of cinematic glory that has little to do with what goes on in other blockbusters.
"In the end, Miller has done it and done it righteously - reimagining a sturdy franchise and living up to the original, while kicking the tired reboot to the curb. Fury Road is rife with activity and fertile with ideas."
"Charlize Theron as Furiosa is freaking amazing in this film. She fights, she's badass, she's so great."
"I left the theatre trembling and with my hands sweating, and that's the best compliment one can give to a movie of this kind. Let the sequels come! [Full review in Spanish]"
Mad Max: Fury Road is a rare successful franchise resurrection; it is an 80s action film with the budget of a modern era film with mind-blowing cinematography
... visually the film is astonishing.
"The action here is fast and furious, and truly out of this world."
[Mad Max's] visual intelligence and wit vastly outweigh its concessions to the genre.
Mad Max: Fury Road is the perfect chick flick for the discerning viewer who prefers her protagonist to be more Ellen Ripley than a musical Charlie's Angel.
"While the original conceit of the Mad Max universe is maintained, the new film surpasses its origins, and offers up a brand new post-Apocalyptic funhouse ride, with a surprisingly thoughtful subtext."
"Nothing about this story is tame. It is filled with relentless non-stop action, violence with a hint of humor."
Insanely creative. Insanely violent. Insanely satisfying.
You need to go see this film. Wins for women in Hollywood are too rare for you not to.
"George Miller has told a story that feels authentic to the world he's created, but that also takes it in a new and fascinating direction."
"The chases and wrecks are artfully choreographed, the constant motion tending toward the balletic."
I can only say that it's one of the purest pieces of filmmaking virtuosity you'll see anywhere.
The memories of the original Mad Max series are intact. This is not more of the same. Fury Road takes you down a different trail.
"It is a wild, inventive, barking-bonkers trumpet voluntary of Wagnerian proportions, and I loved it. I loved it."
"Miller has truly knocked this one out of the park. A home run if I've ever seen one, and one that I'm looking forward to experiencing again."
looks like oil on a hot engine
"Like the original Mad Max trilogy, Miller's dystopia is drenched in political commentary, but while the film's feminism has recently taken center stage, its environmentalism is far more strident."
Miller's commitment to things that look cool cannot be overstated. Mad Max Fury Road is a never-ending stream of such things
"Those in search of a bludgeoning good time will find it in his new scorched-earth action extravaganza, Mad Max: Fury Road -- it's hard to remember the last time a summer tent-pole movie over-delivered in the ways this does."
"Yeah, I get it. I admired the film a lot. But did I love it? Well..."
A machine that roars at full throttle for two solid hours.
"A fun and thrilling film where Miller doesn't take himself too seriously and allows some humor to appear, like the crazy flamethrower guitar player. [Full review in Spanish]"
[Furiosa is] the human touch in this inhumane world and the madly beating heart of this technical wonder of a movie.
A wildly monotonous film that operates at one volume - fortissimo - bludgeoning us over the head into either submission or exhaustion.
[Audiences] will immediately recognize its undeniable prowess and action-classic qualities that have been missing from the world of cinema for quite some time now.
"The craziest, most delirious spectacle you're likely to lay eyes on this year."
"Miller now ranks alongside Gilliam, Lynch, Burton et al as one of cinema's more distinct visionaries thanks to this elseworld of warped, hideous survivors and bizarre contraptions."
"The inventiveness and chutzpah with which Miller keeps this mad pursuit interesting is remarkable, as is the movie's cinematography, and design."
"Although Mad Max is not for everyone, those who want a good shake that doesn't put their neurons at stake will fefinitely appreciate it. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Mad Max: Fury Road captures the joy and style of what action cinema once was -- a good story with convincing characters supported by the stunning choreography of cinematography, editing and production design."
"Mad Max: Fury Road is the action movie we've forgotten to demand, or perhaps we never knew we could ask for."
That argument about how CGI has ruined the popcorn blockbuster is met with maniacal laughter on behalf of Miller and his audacity to stay true to his roots.
"It's not the masterpiece that people prematurely announced, but it's deffinately one of the best films of 2015. [Full review in Spanish]"
Richly visual reboot.
a beefy Tom Clancy-type thriller that takes no prisoners
"Military stories in particular have long gotten away with total homogeneity, but the U.S. military is much more diverse than Hunter Killer suggests."
[Gerard Butler's] in uniform again on screen and he does a wonderful job.
A waterlogged thriller; a sopping wet excuse for Butler to grunt his way through another film that is beneath his talent.
"It may be pure fantasy, but it's smartly paced, unexpectedly complex, action-packed, and thoroughly satisfying."
"Hunter Killer is a dumb movie, but it's a fun dumb movie."
"There are surprises and thrills alongside truly moronic bits of music. Overall, the silliness works against the movie and whatever its ultimate point might be, even if its only goal is to entertain."
Don't think for a second that I don't recognize Hunter Killer for the nearly uninterrupted series of clichés that it is. Yet ... it can be quite engaging.
"I am a simple man with simple tastes. Even so, Hunter Killer... is a bit too simple for me."
More invested in setting up nonsensical action sequences and genre-specific pro-America Oohrah than constructing a story that makes a lick of sense.
The film is too solemn to be a fun diversion without prejudice. [Full Review in Spanish]
A middling sea thriller giving off big explosions and no controversy despite the Russians and Americans involved in an incident at sea.
"Hunter Killer just seems like a futile attempt at pitching action in a brand new playground, underwater."
"A cheesy, laughably simplistic and oftentimes ludicrous work that now feels like a musty relic from an era that has no great degree of nostalgia attached to it."
"The straightforward, solid storytelling makes this mainstream military submarine thriller one that's worth watching."
"If the new motion picture Hunter Killer were real life, it would merit four stars. Unfortunately, the film isn't a striking example of cinema verite but rather a complete piece of fiction. As such, it's a rampaging mediocrity."
"Hunter Killer is long and dull, overstuffed despite having a woefully thin narrative. It should have been entertaining trash ... but instead, it's just a waste of your time."
Far from being earth-shattering but competent enough to be worth a glance on a weekend matinee.
It may closely follow the East-West Underwater Playbook but it's also exciting and fun (until the last quarter when everything falls apart). I was so involved I even used the buttons to tip my cinema seat back as Capt Glass took his submarine underwater.
This is the most boring and generic action movie I've seen in a while. [Full Review in Spanish]
Hunter Killer is a thriller with a great cast that's completely misused and a story that could have been more. [Full Review in Spanish]
"An extremely entertaining, cookie-cut action thriller that falls straight in line with Crimson Tide, K-19 and The Hunt for Red October...If you like your Hollywood military porn large and flashy Hunter Killer is a marvelous made-to-order time killer."
"in this case, the South African Donovan Marsh, becomes, at least, a curious sample of the habitual interpretation of the American cinema of the national reality around his power. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Surprisingly solid, despite basically being The Hunt for Red October on steroids. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Hunter Killer fails to bring anything new into a genre that is uninterested in novelty and cares only about mindless explosions. Not even cool special effects can save the movie from sinking.
Hunter may be worth tracking down for undersea adventure fans looking for a little bit of dumb fun.
Hunter Killer is basically what you think it is-a low-rent Hunt for the Red October that is a straight-up ludicrous hero fantasy.
"It all makes no sense whatsoever, but Hunter Killer may possibly make your day if madcap mindless escapism is what you really need."
"The plot demands some plausibility despite how fictitious it might be, but the script and the realization seem rushed and abandoned from the very beginning. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Muscular direction by Donovan Marsh keeps the action tense and clipping along, compensating somewhat for a tendency of minor characters to blur together."
"Hunter Killer is much closer to London has Fallen, Non-Stop or Battleship than The Hunt for Red October. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Once all this starts coming together, Hunter Killer is absorbing, even if Marsh and his screenwriters never pretend to be half as interested in their characters as they are in the submarines."
This is a world in which time and space have no meaning.
"A fretful submarine saga, appealing primarily to those who enjoy watching imaginary military maneuvers."
An action movie your uncle would have liked after receiving on VHS from Columbia House.
"How this film got a theatrical release at all is quite astounding, given the unashamed levels of direct-to-DVD-bargain-bin filmmaking that's on display here."
This movie is something where it's not memorable enough to actually go in and talk s--- about... it will be forgotten by next week.
A mediocre thriller saddled with unfortunate geo-political timing as well.
"As with so many films that don't know when to wrap it up, there are just too many obstacles and questions left to answer. Still it's fun and the underwater photography's kind of fun too."
This movie is a slog.
It's nice to spend a couple of hours in a fictional world where we don't have to worry about the American president doing something ruinously idiotic and evil. It plays like a nostalgic fairy tale.
[You'll] find more enjoyment watching a plastic yellow submarine sink to the bottom of a bathtub than watching this film.
"A submarine movie for dads... Just simple-headed enough to hit the spot, not quite so ludicrous that it pulls me out of it."
"The title fits what Butler serves up on a silver platter... Hunter Killer still isn't a great movie, but it puts the world order back in place for the better part of two hours as it re-establishes the Russian threat to the American Way."
Submerges itself in familiarity and drowns in clichés.
Such a bland action-thriller that it belongs in the bargain bin at Family Dollar. Not even Walmart. Family Dollar.
A curiously inert attempt at an action film played out in a form reminiscent of a barely competent industrial film rather than a taut suspense flick.
"This military thriller starts stiffly, and not everyone seems fully committed, but as the pieces come together, it becomes a passably tense entertainment for fans of huge explosions."
"In every way, it looks and feels like something slapped together for VOD in the hopes that viewers with a fetish for military equipment will drop six bucks to rent it."
"Splitting the difference between scenes of Navy SEAL rescue attempts, underwater evasive maneuvers and your own countdown clock toward an incipient nap, Hunter Killer feels both generic and underheated."
"At the outset, there are many sub-plots to juggle between; made worse by tonal shifts in each area of a convoluted screenplay. However, those are the least of its problems."
"All the actors are sunk by playing caricatures prone to spitting out leaden, often unintentionally humorous dialogue."
"Watch the film if you like underwater action as some of the scenes are really immersive, otherwise the film has nothing new to offer. Gerard Butler fans would be disappointed for sure."
"Whether on the Arctic wastelands or in the briny depths, the action is consistently sluggish. Uninvolving from start to finish, Hunter Killer is instantly forgettable."
...an unapologetic genre film that treats its material - and the audience - with respect.
"Has no pretensions of being anything more than a meat-and-potatoes thriller lovingly made for the mainstream mall-cineplex crowds. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
"Hunter Killer insults the intelligence of its audience, plays into decades-old politics, and wastes the talents of some solid actors. It's wholly without value."
Save yourself some time and steer clear from this illogical excuse of mainstream cinema.
"Hunter Killer is Medium Butler at best, but right now Medium Butler is still delivering some well-done ham, and you could do a lot worse in terms of a silver screen Big Mac."
"It's more than a bit of a mixed message, to be sure, but you can at least appreciate the delicate depths the studio has taken to try and appease both sides. In the era of rabid, Trump-led tribalism, that's some kind of achievement, anyway."
"Lately, an escape from actual reality seems pretty appealing. On that level, Hunter Killer delivers."
Butler's performance-or lack thereof-keeps Hunter Killer from breaking any ground in the field of war movies.
"Hunter Killer had the target locked in its sights, but it ends up sinking itself, with a story that just doesn't hold water."
"It's a crackling and majestic war movie that navigates rough seas with aplomb, making you realize maybe dad is onto something."
"The further Hunter Killer goes beneath the surface, the better off it is."
"Marsh is in way over his head with the thriller, but he manages a few creative achievements as he sets out to make a movie that's been done before, and much better too."
"The Tom Clancy-Lite plot is disposable and dated... and the action, when it does arrive, is quiet enough to send the most insomnia-plagued of audiences to sleep."
"Though there's always room for a good submarine movie, this silly one, with its comic book plot and cardboard characters, sinks like a stone."
"It's less a submarine picture and more a noisy, oddly structured mashup of Russian military coup, Navy SEALs rescue operation and Gerard Butler's ability to clench his jaw three clicks past the setting ""fully clenched."""
This much mediocrity in one sitting ... eventually starts to wear far too thin.
"An overlong, very silly movie that's still sort of watchable, with Butler as its unlikely center of gravity."
"It's a flavourless, unoriginal, but occasionally charming bit of suspense in the tenor of a Tom Clancy knock-off."
"It aspires to be a taut geopolitical thriller but Donovan Marsh's submarine actioner is hobbled by clichés, middling acting, and the fact that even weirder stuff is happening for real."
This movie embraces its hairy old hokum so thoroughly that it creates a pretty fun contraption.
"The film's second half kicks into gear and plays out like a moderately efficient popcorn thrill ride, even if it's not on the level of sub thrillers like ""Crimson Tide"" or ""The Hunt for Red October."""
"There's some impressive action and a storyline that, let's face it, is no more outlandish than current headlines and much more satisfying."
Storytelling is both serviceable and refreshingly non-reliant on the chaotic cutting that distinguishes so much contemporary action fare.
"I'm happy to report that Hunter Killer does indeed barely keep its head above water, although that might be by moving fast rather than any natural buoyancy."
Hunter Killer... won't win any awards for acting or writing but generates suspense when it needs to and tells an engrossing Tall Tale.
"You know those DVDs that sit in a giant Wal-Mart bin? The kinds of movies usually dumped unceremoniously into theaters in January, and maybe if you're going stir-crazy you take a chance and find yourself happily surprised? Hunter Killer is one of those."
"It is bombastic and garish, ridden with clichés, preposterous politics and diplomacy, and frenetic, video game energy. And it so often so unintentionally silly that it's actually kind of a fun watch."
"While 'Hunter Killer"" bounces between serious and silly, it never quite finds a suitable place to land."
...an aggressively by-the-numbers actioner that squanders a talented roster of actors and seemingly can't-miss setup.
"On a scale from Gerard Butler to 10, how bad is Hunter Killer?"
"When Gerard Butler sets his jaw in an action movie, it doesn't get un-set, mister."
"Listen, no one is going to walk into Hunter Killer expecting Tarkovsky."
Hunter Killer never slows down long enough to establish real tension. A talented cast is wasted.
"The plot has a lot of moving parts, but Marsh fits them together adroitly to deliver a thriller that's consistently exciting and thoroughly preposterous."
I'm probably not gonna remember this movie in t-minus one day.
"Hunter Killer has thrills, but they're of the cheapest variety."
You get more of the same Butler with Hunter Killeras the film that takes us to the bottom of the ocean with it.
"The film is largely uncontroversial, save for a climax that could double as an advertisement for the Navy and America itself."
"However nutty its geopolitics, ""Hunter Killer"" does its job as popcorn thriller with brisk efficiency."
Generic big-screen genre-fiction. Cliched but watchable.
"The movie is overlong, at times confusing, and it's self-important, with a soundtrack that keeps telling us we feel things that we don't. Still, if you like this kind of movie, it's not a bad use of two hours..."
"Thinking about it, maybe I do wish Gerard Butler was screaming and shouting throughout it simply for some amusement. Such a thing would certainly make a better distraction than what 90% of the other characters are up to"
Hunter Killer is replete with sub-TV level CGI and a lot of that thing they did in Star Trek where they had to pretend the set they're on is shaking.
"The constant agitation and bone-deep respect for all things military is straight out of Clancy's playbook, but there's no Jack Ryan figure to humanize it all...There's very little to hold on to. For the most part, we just watch a lot of gears grind..."
The film is a second-rate airport thriller that makes The Hunt for Red October seem like nonfiction by comparison.
Sinks to the bottom.
A healthy dose of laughs and characters you root for can overcome even a handful of ill-considered gags.
"Raunchy and funny in so many wrong ways, I'm giving this film a B+ for the belly laughs it delivers. "
"It’s a real shame that [Jennifer Lawrence] spent a decade playing noted sourpuss Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games and its sequels, as she has better comic timing than just about anyone else from her age cohort."
No Hard Feelings is for the most part good fun and makes for a witty coming of age story for both thirty-two-year-old Maddie and the teen who teaches her some unexpected life lessons.
There is an attempt to pull this disaster out of a tailspin at the end but even the sentimentality of that moment comes across as forced. The only good thing about the final scene is that it signals this mess has come to an end.
"No Hard Feelings does what it says on the box – and a little bit more, thanks to Lawrence, but only just a little bit."
"If No Hard Feelings works, though, it’s largely because of the chemistry between Lawrence and Feldman. They make the dialogue fly, and both have a surprising talent for physical comedy"
No Hard Feelings is a good time. [Full review in Spanish]
"Though No Hard Feelings reverses some sexist clichés of the genre and explores what has changed in contemporary relationships, it doesn't completely lose the bourgeois modesty that was always the true limit of sexual comedies. [Full review in Spanish]"
The comedy never questions having sex for money; a notable point for the comedy by co-writer and director Gene Stupnitsky. [Full review in Spanish]
"No Hard Feelings, which plays super safe for a sex comedy, is just the medicine, as Lawrence makes patently silly scenes work with buckets of flair."
"You’d expect an Oscar-winning actress of her popularity and stature, who presumably has her pick of material, to choose something with a little more substance than a generic sex comedy with a cringy premise.
"
This frisky tale of seduction has a winning couple who add heart to the ribald laughs.
"One of Lawrence’s most interesting characters, her vibrancy blazes beyond the film’s limitations."
"""No Hard Feelings"" isn't the greatest comedy to come along in recent memory, but it stands out for its bold attempt to please its audience with sincerity and vulgarity. The chemistry between the leads is tangible, even if it's meant to be illogical."
No Hard Feelings is reminiscent of 80s views on gender and comedy mixed with the charm of the early 2000s rom-com.  It is charming with enjoyable performances that hopefully will propel Jennifer Lawrence into more comedies
"It’s a film that will make you wince, giggle, and, most importantly, feel as if you just witnessed 90 minutes of straight therapy once its credits begin to roll."
"Despite Jennifer Lawrence's incredibly hilarious performance, No Hard Feelings is a conventional and uneven comedy that plays it too safe. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Lawrence is a comic dream... she's such a natural here that wanting No Hard Feelings to constantly ramp up the OTT antics stems wholly from her performance.
"It's kinda of a throwback to the raunchy comedies of the '80s & '90s... Jennifer Lawrence has good comedic timing... The first two acts work well, but it falls apart in the third act. "
"The movie frequently and cheekily emphasizes the sheer amount of work involved in maintaining some kind of glamorous movie-star mystique, even as people wonder aloud if you’re too old. "
An okay comedy. Nothing like the way it was promoted - but still a little bland.
"JENNIFER LAWRENCE finally gets to flex her comedic chops but after the initial opening moments, the film falls apart & painfully crawls into the second half. The film struggled to find a balanced and consistent tone."
"The best part about No Hard Feelings is that it doesn't limit itself to a ‘sex’ comedy. It turns that gaze inside and extends its purpose to an intense, meaningful romantic comedy."
Jennifer Lawrence & Andrew Barth Feldman are a match made in comedic heaven. I laughed throughout in the theatre!
I can recommend this film as a good solid comedy that is honestly more of a dramedy aspect of anything. This is a hard R Raunchy aspect that we don't get all too often.
"Beyond the strong performances by Lawrence and Feldman, the film falls short and might leave audiences slightly disappointed when it comes to any further depth or thought-provoking elements."
"Lawrence is wonderful, and the film is frequently hilarious, sporting a half-dozen outstanding comedic set-pieces"
"No Hard Feelings isn't extraordinary... but it is a raunchy comedy reminiscent of erotic-youth ""classics"" such as American Pie or Porky's that shies away from the current compulsive search for prestige and political correctness. [Full review in Spanish]
"
"Earns big laughs, particularly from a scene of intense bravery by Lawrence that, if it wasn’t so graphic, would almost certainly play in the montage of clips at her future career achievement award ceremonies."
"If you liked 'American Pie,' you should take a look at 'No Hard Feelings,' another raunchy comedy that might suit your taste."
"Lawrence shows a flair for physical comedy we haven’t seen much of, and she draws strong laughs with Maddie’s clumsily slutty attempts to woo Percy."
"Jennifer Lawrence, however, deserves a stronger script to really justify the work she’s asked to put in. She can bring the laughs (Andrew Barth Feldman can, too), but she’s expected to do too much. "
...progresses into an increasingly tedious and tiresome third act that adopts an almost incongruously sentimental feel...
"The star turn in this screwball battle of the sexes for millenials is no-holds-barred, but the performance of her lead man as a diffident reclusive is sweetly affecting, as they bond despite it all"
A sweetly amusing farce that could only be considered transgressive by a generation for whom 'Licorice Pizza' was their 'Last Tango in Paris.'
"No Hard Feelings has a breezy, pleasurable quality, regardless. And let’s not forget Jennifer Lawrence, who’s as fiery as ever, bringing grit and sass to every vacillating emotion."
"“Feelings” works despite a shaky premise, thanks in large part to Lawrence’s willingness to do anything for a laugh and a breakout performance by Andrew Barth Feldman."
"An R-rated theatrically released comedy is a rare beast, after all. And while this film might be too bawdy for some, and it isn’t quite as strong as Stupnitsky’s other work, it’s a sterling example of sex comedy gone right."
I love this movie.
"This light pick-me-up of a flick is as eager to please as [Jennifer] Lawrence is to show off her luminous physical comedy skills, elevated by the star’s fiery comic timing and effortless drollness. "
"No Hard Feelings is a comeback story in multiple regards. It serves as Jennifer Lawrence‘s high-profile return and, more broadly, a test of the sustainability of comedies on the theatrical scene. "
"A nice and effective mix between sweet rom-com and raunchy comedy, led by Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence, who's great in ""all-in"" mode. Fun stuff. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It is a surprisingly funny film, with an unexpectedly effective comic duo... [Full review in Spanish]"
No Hard Feelings is a good and funny time to spend a few hours in the summer.
"The relationship between Maddie and Percy feels forced as her attempts to get his attention are so aggressive and manic. The film attempts to balance raunchy comedy with a heartfelt coming-of-age story, but ultimately doesn’t do anything special."
"The movie was cute, predictable, enjoyable. I chuckled. I had myself a good time."
"Elevated by strong performances and buoyed by the relative dearth of mainstream comedy films these past several years, No Hard Feelings is worth a trip to the theater for Jennifer Lawrence fans and those simply in the mood for a good laugh. "
"While it's a predictable been-there-done-that comedy with some eye-rolling ridiculous moments, I somehow did find myself genuinely guffawing more than once and JLaw brings it whatever the role."
A coming of age story that has some raunchy humor BUT also a tender heart.
... the movie gets more and more solemn and talky and full of lesson-learning.
"The movie has plenty of big bawdy laughs, many courtesy of Jennifer Lawrence's fearless performance."
"No Hard Feelings is the antithesis of family friendly, but perfectly treads the line between risqué and offensive. One minute you’re laughing to the point of tears, the next you’re asking yourself, “Am I a bad person?”"
No Hard Feelings manages to capture how two people with different backgrounds and levels of experience can still connect in a way that's not solely about the physical
"Despite it being about some troubled and sometimes mean-spirited people, the movie does have its high points and some really funny cringey humor. It's very of its time and pretty fun - even if a little predictable and a throwback to less sensitive times."
"While Lawrence has the film’s best jokes and storyline, the movie works only because of the equally effective comedic turn of A Tourist’s Guide to Love‘s Feldman."
"There's a reason why Jennifer Lawrence is one of the youngest Oscar winners. She plays Maddie with such nuance and complexity, and delivers a performance that will make viewers forget the shadiness of the film's premise."
"I am about to recommend a mildly raunchy R-rated comedy for one simple reason: I had fun watching it. I am so sick and tired of overlong, overproduced, formulaic “content” that this insignificant movie looks like a work of genius in comparison. 
"
"It appears to be a raucous sex comedy, but it ends up sentimental and predictable. "
"While the film favors sweetness over raunch in a way that makes for a messy third act, Lawrence’s performance holds it all together with real heart. "
"No Hard Feelings doesn’t mean any harm, and more power to it."
No Hard Feelings is a welcome addition to a dwindling genre — and a reminder that Lawrence is one of Hollywood's best (and funniest) leads. 
"A refreshing blast of raucous, grown-up comedy infuses what is actually a sweet coming-of-age journey for an oddball couple. "
" It’s a journey for both characters to venture together to discover they both are worth more as people. It may sound like many conclusions before it, and it indeed is. But you’ll get a kick out of how these characters reach it."
"[An] amusing but instantly forgettable romp. The unstoppable force of Lawrence’s charisma notwithstanding, this is not so much tasteless, just a bit bland."
"Questions abound -- about sex, class and basic morality -- and an R-rated comedy like this one might seem ill-equipped to handle them. What a pleasant surprise, then, to find that the movie has more going on under its hood. "
"Yet for all its juvenile-yet-adults-only antics, No Hard Feelings lives up to its title, offering a surprisingly sentimental take on the unlikely relationship at its core. "
"This is a clichéd, dreary and often just plain pitiful attempt at a comedy about women, directed by Gene Stupnitsky, which doesn’t use the wonderful skills of the actress."
"If it isn’t going to deliver on the raunch, No Hard Feelings could at least deliver on quality, and it does not."
"None of No Hard Feelings’s big set piece scenes works, largely because Percy hasn’t been conceived as anything other than the butt of the joke, and the mean-spiritedness leaves the film with nowhere to go."
"The premise is never once credible, and director and co-writer Gene Stupnitsky peppers this astoundingly unfunny film with implausible set pieces that have clip-worthy kudos and nothing else."
"It’s a romantic comedy so feebly constructed, so lazily written, so devoid of wit and charm, that the ghost of Billy Wilder must be choking on his celestial cigar."
"... The film runs off with a crazy premise that respects the principles of the genre and reverses gender roles, mastering the 'hot slapstick', and if not, there's the wild night scene on the beach. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Thank goodness for No Hard Feelings, in which Lawrence looks like she’s having the most fun she’s ever had on-screen, finally releasing the pent-up screwball energy she’s never been able to fully channel into her characters before."
... A modern screwball comedy. [Full review in Spanish]
This felt like a genuine callback to some of my favorite comedies. Jennifer Lawrence should be doing more roles like this!
No Hard Feelings is a comedy looking in vain for an audience.
"It’s a throwback with a modern twist, headlined by a star who isn’t afraid to be goofy, silly, and sincere – sometimes that’s all a movie really needs to succeed."
"The supporting cast is strong, there are plenty of wonderful set pieces, and Lawrence throws herself into all this ribald madness with gleefully intoxicating abandon."
"Jennifer Coolidge's Stifler's mom in ""American Pie"" was a fun cougar. J-Law's Maddie Barker in ""No Hard Feelings"" won't exactly make you reach for your phone to call child protective services, but the thought will cross your mind."
A raunchy comedy.
"Once you get over what is a sex-worker-for-hire-on-Craigslist story, JLaw has a lotta cojones in taking this into the harsh light of Hard-R-rated land. But why must we learn lessons & have a redundant happy ending? And why is Matthew B. now Cameron's Dad?"
"Doesn’t re-invent the wheel, but it’s a hilarious, fun, and raunchy comedy entry with a star that makes it look so easy."
The story focuses more on friendship than it does on sex. It's actually a very sweet film.
"The game of ping pong that [Jennifer Lawrence] and [Andrew Barth Feldman] play ... is irresistible fun, and the walls they've both respectively built are joyously picked apart in the most unexpected comedy of the summer."
"Jennifer Lawrence is all in, but Oscar winner can't save conflicted comedy."
"With jerky tonal shifts to make you feel as though you’re experiencing repeated whiplash, the movie veers off course in several directions that don’t make very much sense – not that we expect this format to be remotely plausible."
"Jennifer Lawrence gives 110% in a gutsy performance and Andrew Barth Feldman plays his part to perfection. It may be a bit watered down for young adults, but perfect for older moviegoers. Did you just walk out of a feel-good comedy? Yep."
No Hard Feelings has more heart and relatability than just about any other film I’ve seen from a Hollywood studio so far this year; it also has more laughs per minute than most of them as well.
"No Hard Feelings is a coming of age story told through two vastly different
perspectives. This R-rated raunchy comedy may not always land, but the film excels with the
relationships developed between characters and the performances leading the way."
No Hard Feelings is equally heartfelt and hilarious and will stick in the memory long after other modern comedies have come and gone. At the very least you’ll never look at someone getting suplexed the same way again.
The film gets its big laughs but is ultimately a much sweeter (and even sadder) story that really comes to life thanks to the performances by Lawrence and Feldman as well as being one of the better eat-the-rich commentaries we have seen lately.
Lawrence energy and likeability navigates around some of the script’s sloppier choices.
"Not even J-Law off the nice-young-lady leash can save something this lazy and desperate to offend, however. The movie simply isn’t on her level. Or really much of any level at all."
"Credit Lawrence with finding a worthwhile character in a movie that offers unexpected rewards for those who’ll see it, whether that’s in theaters or, more likely, after it wades into the more hospitable waters of pay TV and streaming"
"No Hard Feelings is raunchy, refreshing, and heartfelt. Jennifer Lawrence is perfect these types of films. It falters a bit in the last act, but still quite funny and enjoyable. "
Letting Jennifer Lawrence have fun in a movie like this was nice to see. No Hard Feelings isn’t a perfect movie but it’s fun and we all deserve some pure dumb enjoyment. 
The raunchy comedy lurches from chuckle-funny to cringeworthy.
"The R-rated, hit-and-miss romp has just enough wit and heart to carry the day over the utterly predictable plot and the occasional bit of physical comedy that misses the mark."
The movie’s central failing is that the comedic elements aren’t as consistent or funny as they should be.
"For all of its joys, the holiday season can be a time of comparison, envy, and heartache, and Best. Christmas. Ever! portrays that in a really thought-provoking and realistic way as it reminds us that no life or person is as perfect as it may seem. "
"More of a holiday concept than legit film, Netflix’s flimsy and phony offering flounders around and strands Heather Graham and pop singer/actor Brandy Norwood, not to mention Jason Biggs and Matt Cedeno, in the cinematic equivalent of a lump of coal."
"Best.Christmas.Ever! might have an ambitious title, but its sweet message and heartfelt message of appreciation will win over most Scrooges."
"This is a film that probably reads better on paper than it plays on screen due to some awkward pacing and clunky editing, but a more serious second half allows for a heartwarming ending. "
I gave Best. Christmas. Ever! my undivided attention. What I found was an uncanny valley-esque experience that I have to confess I found difficult to translate into the usual form of what we humans know as a ‘film review’.
"It's still early in the season, but all viewers should want for Christmas is that Best. Christmas. Ever! won’t be the best holiday title on offer."
"Best. Christmas. Ever! is nothing more than a light-hearted comedy, made to be watched with the family and presumably while we put up the Christmas tree. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The title of the movie feels ironic here, when it's probably closer to being one of the worst Christmas movies ever."
"The best you can say for this — aside from Netflix finding work for older writers and directors — is that it’s shiny, childish background noise that might keep a child distracted long enough for adults to get a turkey in the oven"
[Brandy and Heather Graham] explore their character’s strained female friendship with care and nuance. These over-the-top Christmas shenanigans will make you grateful for what you have and for the people around you… with a pinch of Santa’s magic too. 
It’s a bit presumptuous (and maybe even intentionally ironic) to title a movie Best. Christmas. Ever! (Nov. 16) when the film itself falls below the standard of even the most mediocre of the streamer’s original holiday movies.
It’s as artificial as an aluminum Christmas tree. “Best. Christmas. Ever!” isn’t the worst movie ever…but it’s close.
"Best. Christmas. Ever! is not the most splendiferous Christmas movie ever, but it will satisfy those hungry for new sentimental holiday movies.

"
"Christmas films should be filled with magic, hope, and all the trimming and traditions to get you in the holiday spirit. Best. Christmas. Ever! does this with its colorful sets, intense decorations, huge snowfalls, and family traditions."
"Its absurdist lunacy acts as a Trojan Horse containing genuinely meaningful sentiments on forgiveness, happiness and bittersweet sorrows — universalities people tend to reflect on as their year comes to a close."
"“Best. Christmas. Ever!” resembles a television holiday special more than a feature film, and its plot follows the predictable Christmastime themes of love, acceptance, and being thankful for what you’ve got."
"At less than 80 minutes, it’s barely even a movie, more one long montage of bits that never run on long enough to be defined as scenes."
"Norwood fans hoping for something as hard-hitting as any random episode of “Moesha” will be disappointed, but she does a nice duet of “Let It Snow” with Biggs and sings another pleasant carol over the closing credits."
"Its message is an important one and one that will resonate with many, even if the delivery takes a while to fall into place."
It takes everything amazing about the first film and kicks it up a notch.
"The problem is that I don’t see anything new being learned or discovered here. It's fun and the characters are engaging, but all of it is ultimately connected to past movies or themes. And it's familiar."
"The problem is that the movie is constantly, almost compulsively, deflecting in order not to make it too, too clear what it’s actually about."
"It's super fun, exciting, and surprising. [Full review in Spanish]"
"…a hard-sell for a 60 year old product you already bought, used, grew out of and got bored of some time ago…"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is AMAZING and a REVOLUTIONARY achievement in animation. It’s a wild and darker journey that is FULL of JAW-DROPPING surprises. Spider-Man has never looked so good.
"Everything audiences have seen thus far from the first frame of ""Into"" to the last of ""Across"" means something to the larger story, and it’s been in front of us the whole time."
A sequel that’s just as good as its predecessor.
"For a 140 min film, you’ll feel like you’re in an art gallery in the sense that you know there’s not enough time in the day to see everything, so you go ahead and make an internal commitment to come back. "
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a brilliant film with empathetic writing and characters we care about not to mention a visual masterpiece. It transcends genre to be one of the most enjoyable and engrossing releases of 2023.
"'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' travels worlds to upend its own status quo, spinning a truly unique and sometimes devastating narrative that finally matches its visual ambitions."
"A giddying swing through a dizzying array of animation styles, this sequel to ‘Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse’ is an epic joy-ride on the space-time continuum"
"Thank you for the contrasting animation styles that express and enhance each separate universe. Thank you for the unparalleled artistry, the emotional story, the playful humor, and the invigorating action. "
"Against all odds, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is even better than its predecessor laying credible claim to one of the strongest comic book entries ever. No need for an asterisk limiting it to just the animation category."
"The result is a production that is so overwhelming, it may never be fully appreciated even with a multiverse of viewings."
"Its visual design is preceded by nothing save for the first Spider-Verse, and Lord and Miller oversee further progression by crafting distinctive aesthetics for each of the half-dozen or so universes within this narrative."
"Spider–Man: Across the Spider–Verse is gloriously additive, and the result is the best comic book movie ever made."
"Across the Spider-Verse is the emotionally driven Spiderman movie people have been waiting for. There is no death gimmick used here to driven the emotion, instead it's driven by a great story that leans on a parents love and understanding. "
"Although the animation is still terrific, casual admirers of the first film might want to bow out because there are fewer jokes and a solemn devotion to Spider-Man lore."
"Thrillingly inventive visuals, an absolute can't-miss movie in spite of having not much to say and insisting on saying it anyway."
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the epitome of incredibly detailed, gorgeously unique, undeniably epic animation within its medium."
"While the abundance of animation and plethora of characters surrounding Miles might seem daunting for a comic book movie about a teenage Spider hero, the good outweighs the bad in ""Across the Spider-Verse."" The runtime goes by in a flash."
"The music, the animation, the characters, and the story all come together to create the greatest Spider-Man movie."
"Unapologetically heavy-handed with its stylistic approach, Across the Spider-Verse is a beautifully crafted love letter to every era of Spider-Man’s meaningful history."
A cosmic shift happened in 2018 when Into the Spider-Verse premiered in terms of its animation style and colors. Across the Spider-Verse proves that it was not a one-hit wonder.
"Across the Spider-Verse relentlessly refuses to be constrained by the borders of its canvas, with its incredible imagery and absorbing ideas utilizing the medium to its full advantage."
"Across The Spider verse takes it to another LEVEL! The animation/art styles are spectacular, the character dynamics and relationships are complex and layered. It’s a nonstop multiversal adventure that puts its story first above all. "
All the money in the world can't make people in tights standing against green screens as visually spectacular and emotionally expressive as the Spider-Verse films. 
"Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is not only one of the best films of 2023 it is one of the greatest animated films of all time.

The look and feel of this franchise is so uniquely original that it sets itself apart from anything else in the genre."
"This is a fantastic movie. Visually very impressive, has a good heart of a story and good character development. "
"The top-tier (and awards-worthy) animation is drowned by the surplus of characters, jokes, and new sights forcefully crammed in every frame."
"It’s smart stuff, leaps and bounds beyond Marvel’s snarky hegemony..."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse features gorgeous animation and non-stop thrills with a killer ending that makes me excited for the next film!
"Spiderverse 2 is not just the BEST Spider-Man film of all time, it’s not just the BEST COMIC BOOK FILM of all time, it’s not just the greatest sequel ever made, it’s bar none one of the best films I’ve ever watched. More than a masterpiece. "
An explosion of creativity and genius as vast as the number of Spider-Man variants inhabiting the infinite realms within the Marvel cosmos.
"...a complete trainwreck of a motion picture that has absolutely no business running an astonishing, seemingly never-ending 140 minutes."
"an energetic, multifaceted adventure... As visually inventive as its 2018 predecessor, ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE again delivers eye-catching action along with characters of depth and nuance both behind and outside of the mask."
"It's amazing how far ""let's make this thing look and feel like a comic book"" can go."
"I’m sure Marvel won’t mind if you buy all the merchandise and comic books related to all those Spider-Folks, too."
[W]hat’s fast becoming this series’ calling card: action sequences that defy all spatial orientation and come at you at the speed of thought while meticulously maintaining coherence and clarity of audience focus.
"While bigger doesn't always mean better, the larger canvas and more elaborate logistics here, in terms of narrative scope and thematic heft, make for a dazzling time at the movies for many (most?) age groups."
"Across the Spider-Verse will be viewed as a landmark in animation, and rightfully so."
"A funny, heartfelt, and infinitely rewatchable action-comedy that ranks among the superhero genre’s very best. 
"
"The original ""Into the Spider-verse"" has a lot of moments that I love. But I think this one actually has more moments that I love."
"It’s Easter-egg heaven for fans, a frenetic “Where’s Waldo?” of maximalist splatter-paint pop art. And no doubt it’s an impressive artistic feat. But if Spidey can be anyone or anything, does the beloved specificity of Spider-Man lose its appeal?"
"The type of film that proves animation isn't just for kids, and it's certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It's an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema."
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse contains some of the finest animation ever put to film. There are stretches that feel revolutionary, glass-ceiling breaks into a new future.

"
"The triangle of directors decides to take very seriously the playfulness that is breathed in the center of Spider-Man, to lead to a work that is endearing at times and theoretical at others, but embraced by a visuality that never loses sight of the game"
"Sly, subliminally superb - if self-indulgent - animated superhero saga that becomes an exhausting endurance ordeal...."
For the hard core Spiderman follower it is manna from Heaven; for the casual viewer it is almost impossible to figure out.
"“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is the epitome of the complete art form. Films are a perfect collection of individual art forms....This movie is funny, engaging, masterfully animated and one of the best films ever made"
Tempts you to think Spider-Man was always meant to be animated. 
"Absolutely visually stunning, although it meanders a bit when it comes to plotting. "
"An outstanding assemblage and use of talent across all facets of filmmaking. The animation itself is the most obvious selling point but in a world where most big budget movies feel like an AI script with studio interference, this screenplay soars. "
You'd be having the time of your life even if the filmmakers decided to phone the plot in. That they didn't results in a dense work that stimulates the senses more than even INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE could.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse boldly throws out any restraint and leans full-tilt into the zaniness of its visually and thematically kaleidoscopic world. 
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse loses none of its predecessor's magnetic cool, nor the admirable blend of sensibility and novelty permeated within every image. [Full review in Spanish] "
"Here’s the great news about this excellent Spider-Man film series--it’s like nothing you’ve ever seen before, the animation and live-action set the film apart into its own genre"
Viewers feel invested in sharing each success and failure with Gwen and Miles... nothing else comes close to the level of ambition poured out onto the screen... until next year’s (conclusion) mercifully unknots your stomach.
"A fun, funny and dazzling adventure that feels groundbreaking and important in a multitude of ways."
"There may be a point to all the far-fetched complications in the multiple story lines of this movie, but we'll have to wait until next year to find out if there is. "
"This movie exceeded all expectations. If you don't like this film, I don't know what you are looking for in movies..."
This was an incredible experience. This movie brought me back to my childhood and reignited my love of animation. 
One of my top five films of all time. I didn't want it to end. 
"While the visuals once again addictively shut down and reboot a viewer’s mind repeatedly, the scripting is not as enthralling or involving as it was before."
"Sun-Spider is voiced by Danielle Perez, herself a wheelchair user. Nor is Sun-Spider the only disabled character in the film."
"A cinematic work of art, boasting style and substance with its kinetic, boundary-pushing animation and weighty, dramatic themes of longing and belonging."
"From the colorful animation to the impressive voice performances to the diverse and heartfelt characters, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse manages to recapture all of the magic that made the first film such a hit."
Across the Spider-Verse isn't just the best comic book film in 2023 to date. It's one of the best films in any genre.
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is one of the greatest animated sequels where it takes what made the original highly praised, and elevate it into one of the biggest love letters to Spider-Man."
"A billion different art styles collide, with impressionism bleeding into pop art, all set to a punk-hip-hop backbeat in pursuit of asking America’s current defining question: What do we need to do to get more Spider-Cat?"
Animated Spider-Man sequel is worth the price of admission in this four-star movie.
An irresistible and energetic animation Spidey sequel.
"Across the Spider-Verse proves that animation can be a liberating, fantasy-deepening medium that live-action can’t touch. It’s one of the best summer blockbuster to hit screens in years."
An extravagant blend of styles and visual ideas and techniques that makes the bleeding-edge radicalism of the 2018 film seem downright boring.
"The latest Spider-Man has been called unique, but this is something else--a superhero flick whose characters have personality and dramatic heft, filled with wonderful visuals and wondrous exploits laced with brazen originality. "
"Diving once again into the Spider-Verse is a delight; unlike many well-worn and exhausted Marvel products, the potential of this franchise feels endless. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Extraordinary animation and muscular transformations make the continuing Spidey saga(s) of Brooklyn teen Miles Morales and his family, friends and foes even more of a marvel."
"The filmmakers seem committed to the idea that there can't be too much of a good thing. I think some pruning might have helped, but Across the Spider-Verse reflects a commitment to a visual vision that's meant to dazzle the senses -- and often does."
SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE is without question one of the very best films of 2023 so far. 
Across the Spiderverse is one of the most visually dazzling animated films I've ever seen. The story and characters continue to be great while being only half of a story that ends on a pretty rough cliffhanger is sure to frustrate some viewers.
"Across the Spider-Verse feels like a piece of Banksy-inspired street art that is so monumentally cluttered yet mesmerizing at the same time. Flashy visuals, but a story that feels like it's stretched beyond its means."
A winning combination of heart and humor backed by some of the most engrossing and hypnotic artwork you’re likely to see in theaters.
I think it is storytelling and character development at its greatest.
The real magic here is the absolute immersion that the viewer goes through to quite literally see a comic book come to life - you've never seen anything quite like it.
"Vibrant, poignant and completely avant-garde: it’s nothing I’ve seen or felt before in an animated feature, and the energy it imbues onto audiences is, like a bite from a radioactive spider, infectious."
"There's artistry in every aspect, from the color choices to the backgrounds to the character designs to the framing and composition, and everything else on screen. I keep wanting to go back & watch it again just to get lost in and immersed by all this..."
"Chaotic, ferociously paced, frenetic and fun, Across The Spider-Verse almost goes too far in this more-is-more approach."
"There’s plenty to work with in this vertiginous, cyclonic, kaleidoscopic collage. The filmmakers employ a hybrid of CGI and animation which is supposed to make the viewer feel like they have entered a comic book."
"It’s been a bit since I watched the original Spider-Verse, but the animation is either as good or better than that film."
"You're gonna have a good time with this. The character development is top-notch -- you care about Miles, you care about Gwen you care about the family members, you care about the friends."
The animation in Across the Spider-Verse is spectacular. It’s breathtakingly innovative and cinematic but also deeply indebted to the comic book form.
"It might be hyperbole to say that this state-of-the art animation is about as genius as it gets for the genre. But for kids, teens and twentysomethings, raised on MTV, comic books and TikTok, that isn’t an overstatement. It’s their truth."
"The smashing together of styles new and old, the way the hyper-modern is edged with the Roy Lichtenstein-esque pointillism of the original comic books, makes for a retro-futuristic spectacle once again."
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a fantastic sequel, and many who loved the first will love the second. It is original, and that is no small achievement for a sequel."
Across the Spider-Verse plays to young viewers' wild imaginative energy while showcasing immense adult craft -- the recipe for a film that even a superhero skeptic can enjoy.
Capturing the feel of this movie in words feels impossible.
"It’s hard to resist the swirling fight scenes and the moments of serenity shared by Miles and Gwen. Pixels put the Spider-Verse in peril, but they also beautifully bridge the vast distance between a girl and a boy."
A genuinely thrilling sequel that once again sets the bar extremely high for inventive and imaginative animation.
"So, a movie that is 40 minutes or more longer than it should be constitutes a plus for the fans – who will, I think, enjoy it immensely – and a big minus for me."
"The shock value here is quite....forward, but don't let that get in the way of the absolutely fierce performance by Barry Keogan. "
"Mr. Keoghan has an uncanny ability to come across as shifty and devious even in repose, and his performance is the key to the movie."
"It is through its unapologetic manipulation that a movie which might easily otherwise have been just another mindless, lurid thriller [turn] into a savage piece of cinema that you’ll want to see again and again."
"Unlike ""Promising Young Woman,"" it doesn’t tap into the rage of its day. It’s just purposelessly unpleasant."
"It’s “The Talented Mr. Ripley” meets “Call Me By Your Name” — insidious, class conscious, with a bit of violence and a serious taste of the sexually kinky if not downright icky."
"Fine, disreputable fun until what might be the stupidest, most misguided ending I’ve seen since… well, since Fennell’s previous picture."
"Fennell’s stunning visuals and Barry Keoghan’s excellence lift ""Saltburn"" to must-watch status."
"Disturbing and brilliant, with vile characters who will stay with you long after you make their acquaintance. "
"This movie is a combination of Brideshead Revisited and The Talented Mr. Ripley. The first two acts are fantastic...but frankly the 3rd act goes off the rails with too many twists turns, trying to keep you engaged and it did not work for me. "
"Fennell's filmmaking skills have vastly improved over the past three years, and her writing is even more ambitious."
"Saltburn isn't the same kind of movie as [Fennell's] debut, but it goes farther than you'd ever expect it to, and it definitely leaves you with the sense that you've seen something. Or, rather, that you've been punched in the eyes. "
"A clever, queasy drama, with a terrific star turn from its lead actor, that dares to drive a twisted story about class envy and class war to a risky conclusion"
"We're asked to be shocked by developments that are, to be frank, predictable, and in the process, any pretense of meaningful class satire goes out the window."
"Given the contempt and cynicism on display, the film is watchable enough; it certainly doesn’t hurt that most of the roles have been taken by beautiful people."
"Despite its shortcomings, Saltburn is transfixing both in its direction and its acting."
"But by the end of it, I just felt like I I've seen this movie before."
"There’s fertile ground for satire here, but that would require a scalpel, and Fennell wields a blunt hatchet."
Emerald Fennell’s deliciously dark comedy sticks the knife into the English class system and gives it a proper twist.
"Like “Promising Young Woman,” Fennell’s Oscar-winning film, “Saltburn” slices someone else’s life, then teaches us plenty about our own.

It’s a twisty, turny drama that will make you think twice about ever accepting another invitation."
"[Keoghan] carries this diversionary tale of ""eat the rich"" politics right through a silly curtain lift that makes it seem Fennell thinks we're as vapidly dumb as the Cattons covering their eyes when THE RING is on TV."
"Love it or loathe it, Emerald Fennell’s deliciousl takedown of the upper classes keeps you glued to Barry Keoghan as a poorboy driven to madness and worse by a rich Adonis (Jacob Elordi) and his hilariously vampiric mom (an Oscar-ready Rosamund Pike)."
Emerald Fennell's Saltburn is diabolically entertaining.
"It’s an entertaining film, but a mixed bag, filled with over-the-top moments and plot twists, but at the end it feels less than the sum of its parts."
A showcase for Keoghan with a bravura bare-all performance but all the boundary-pushing moments ultimately amount to a shallow and vile endeavor.
The Talented Mr. Ripley for the cool kids.
Performances by Keoghan and Pike make this scenario work. It could have just worked a little better if Fennell had shown a little more courage in putting the twists into the finale.
"In a short time, “Saltburn” has become one of the most divisive films of the year, and it's not hard to see why; I don't think Fennell's intentions were bad, but the final product certainly could have been better thought out. Full review in Spanish."
While I think the film is visually sumptuous and striking... It doesn't feel like it has a lot of substance. 
"It's good, but familiar. "
"One expects this development will effectively end Oliver’s time at Saltburn, but it only serves to embolden Oliver and motivate him to show his true colors. Let’s just say Saltburn and many of its denizens will never be the same."
"If reports of audiences clutching their collective pearls over male full-frontal nudity, masturbation, oral sex, baby-batter bathwater scandalizes you, then stay away from Yorgos Lanthimos’ films because they would devastate you."
"Fennell certainly has an eye for striking imagery, but has unfortunately yet to deploy it in a way that feels thematically coherent. "
"Where Promising Young Woman was a revenge story, Saltburn is an entirely different beast--social power and class privilege will never be the same."
"The golden summer, the life-changing friendship, the fantasy location: they are all put under fantastical, acutely-realised pressure here. It’s an astonishing cinematic experience, both oddly light and viscerally nasty."
"Questionable late-movie choices don’t diminish Saltburn’s admirable qualities: its audacity, energy, and unpredictability."
"Emerald Fennell is a fearless director, Saltburn offers a cold-blooded but riotous ride through the minds of people who have spent too long looking into cracked mirrors hoping to see a reflection of something worthwhile looking back at them."
"Saltburn just goes too far, and its startling images shocked me out of the story altogether."
"Saltburn is a solid sophomore effort from Fennell and cements that she is one of the most talented filmmaking voices working today, but it is not as balanced as her debut film."
Fennell deserves praise for the way she continues to incorporate queer characters and storylines into her work. Where Saltburn goes slightly awry is that some scenes... feel endless.
The platonic romance between Oliver and Felix is just the icing on a somewhat bloated but undoubtedly lavish and tasty social satirical cake. [Full review in Spanish]
"Certain to upset pious viewers while thrilling those who love twisted, decadent thrillers. And, oh my goodness, what an ending."
"Saltburn dazzles in its finale but stumbles through a disjointed narrative. Despite artistic strengths, uneven storytelling hinders its potential, falling short of Fennell's previous triumph in Promising Young Woman."
"Longing for someone can be a dangerous thing, and Emerald Fennell perfectly captures that in this imperfect queer masterpiece."
"A character who acts without context or motivation is not compelling to me. Saltburn tries to shock us, again and again—instead, it ends up being a bit of an empty suit."
"There’s no one at all to like in Ms Fennell’s film, which may undermine its aspirations to moral seriousness. But it’s a bit of a laugh, especially early on."
"“Saltburn” feels at times like a John Waters film as it moseys through “Talented Mr. Ripley” territory, occasionally taking a pit stop in Divine’s neck of the woods before reaching its Downton Abbey-on-poppers destination. Devilishly entertaining."
"Combining social satire and psychological thriller, “Saltburn” holds your attention, but its contrivances grow increasingly grating as it scrambles to its supposedly astonishing climax. "
"Films set on ornate British estates tend to be stuffy period pieces, so Fennell’s story is initially a breath of fresh air, telling a more modern version that’s full of life."
"Saltburn is neither biting nor smart, and its denouement lacks the mixture of joy, rage, and hopelessness many feel while stuck in the system’s fist."
"I've seen Keoghan in many movies but I barely recognized him in ""Saltburn."" It's a high-wire act and, even if ""Saltburn"" isn't always sure what it's doing, Keoghan never misses a beat."
"Visually, the movie can be quite pretty. Linus Sandgren, Damien Chazelle’s go-to cinematographer, shot it. Emotionally, it’s ugly through and through, which the prettiness makes that much uglier."
"…slapdash, exhausting, vacuous…the kind of hambone justification of elite rule that couldn’t be more out of step with today…"
Saltburn toes the blurred line between a positive reclamation of the ‘evil gays’ trend and a negative stereotype.
"The film has a good craft, the house they got for filming was stunning, but that is not enough for me to think something is a good movie."
A risible and hollow Talented Mr. Ripley for the Euphoria generation.
"Saltburn is neither a triumph nor catastrophe, which is often the case with directors making their sophomore efforts after exploding onto the scene. However, it is compelling enough to remain optimistic about one of Britain’s brightest filmmaking voices. "
"'Saltburn' continues the [Fennell's] grand ability to apply pressure. Not only can the characters feel that challenge with each other, but so can the audience with Fennell’s visuals and situational intensities. Inventive, bold and fearless!"
"More formulaic and less genuinely audacious than it thinks it is, the film is an entertaining mix of dark comedy and psychological thriller, rich on morbid fun and intoxicating visuals. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"While it’s whip smart and wickedly daring, “Saltburn” is also excessively repellant and depressing."
Saltburn is a summer-break journey into bourgeois excess and sociopathic tenacity that wrapped its seductive tentacles around my throat and then spent 127 glorious minutes gently tightening its slithery embrace.
"Oliver Quick, portrayed by ever-reliably odd Barry Keoghan, (is) followed from a nice opening tracking shot entering Oxford, until a cleverly stunning closer of same almost saves writer/director Emerald Fennell's second real doozy of a film."
"Despite a mischievous audacity, it rarely digs beneath its surface provocations."
"Sleek, smart, and in possession of a devious streak. "
"""Saltburn"" might not be as original as the Oscar-winning ""Promising Young Woman,"" but it promises its audience a wild ride and constant twists and turns that disgust and delight."
"Saltburn -- by including images that invite averted eyes  -- can be viewed as a movie that dresses for dinner and then throws up on itself. On another, it's a daring comic display of the base motivations that underly class privilege."
Come for the class warfare and the occasional shots-fired zingers about the rich being different than you and me. Stay for Keoghan.
"Fennell loses her creative self within this glaringly phony world of debauchery and opulence. As a result, things like narrative structure, story progression, and character development get tossed aside for warped and edgier grasps for attention."
"A glossy romp through hipster affluence, Saltburn is all style and limited substance."
"It's a dark and twisted cross between Cruel Intentions and The Talented Mr. Ripley but super weird as sh**. I wanted to love this more but was mostly disappointed in the first 45 mins but the picks up in the 2nd half and ends on a strong note. 

"
"Fennell revels in excess and tries to comment on it, but none of it lands outside of the performances and lavish production value."
"Saltburn comes across not primarily as a satire of the upper-class, but as a warning about the (too smart, too sexual, insufficiently heterosexual) rabble."
"At times deliciously campy & twisted, and at others painfully simplistic & melodramatic, the story plays out much how you’ll expect, with provocation after provocation attempting to distract from the obvious lack of substance. But hey, it looks gorgeous!"
"Nothing about Saltburn is particularly surprising, although writer/director Emerald Fennell certainly seems to believe much of it is."
Keoghan convincingly embraces this complex young man and his conflicting emotions ... His portrayal is stellar and his utter commitment to the picture’s naked end is applaud-worthy.
"This isn’t a deep psychological dive into normal versus psychopathy. Fennell is looking at the glossy surface of social climbing. Consequently, the film lacks the emotional bite that this kind of noir-ish satire demands. "
"Saltburn flails around a bit and sometimes feels confused, overwrought, overlong, even borderline campy. But stick with it. It ultimately adds up to a potent piece of moviemaking, and of storytelling."
"Having put a high sheen on hoary narrative conventions, which prove seductive, “Saltburn” reveals itself as simply a pastiche of repackaged goods."
"This is an exquisitely shot, multilayered, psycho-sexual film that goes way too far. Fennell takes you on a shocking journey to find out who can master the game of riches in this salacious state of affairs that is Saltburn. "
How can a scholarship student at Oxford University relate to his privileged classmates? That’s the dilemma for poor Oliver Quick who looks as drab as others find him but has one advantageous attribute: he assesses individuals astutely
"It’s tough to watch a film that asks you to empathize with, much less pity, the grotesquely wealthy. Luckily, Fennell doesn’t. "
"Make no mistake, the clever writing is here, as is the style, the sleek technique, and some terrific performances (Rosamund Pike is especially delicious in a supporting role). What’s missing, or muddled, is the message -- and perhaps even more, the heart."
Barry Keoghan brings the swagger in Emerald Fennell’s tasty black comedy. 
"""Saltburn"" is a revenge opera that's more silly than it is serious — ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" for the millennial crowd — and it feels like one that Fennell needed to get out of her system in able to move forward. "
"Keoghan delivers what can only be described as an impressively committed performance in a movie that, in the end, considers itself way more shocking than it really is."
"As a theatrical provocation, “Saltburn” is just what the doctor ordered. "
"There’s no depth to the images, no character who isn’t bent to the task of provocation, and nowhere for the story to go except a murderous spiral of jaw-dropping ludicrousness."
"Saltburn is a dizzying, wicked spell of lust, lies, and betrayal. It’s one of the best films I’ve seen all year, but I know it will be divisive for audiences.

"
"Although the film takes place in this century, Fennell and her production team give it a timeless look, often with candlelight. It’s appropriate, as what’s unspooling is as old as human interaction."
Fennell has made a different kind of period film from The Talented Mr. Ripley and Brideshead Revisited. Saltburn is an indie sleaze fantasia for older millennials that succeeds more as a character study than a thriller.
"You can feel yourself getting fatter off its empty calories, but the dopamine hit is real, like eating a greasy-spoon cheeseburger after a night of heavy drinking. Or whatever the 1% equivalency might be."
"You watch wishing it were better, but nonetheless pulled into this dark story of a young man navigating a world where he’s invisible."
"If cameras have a caffeine-laced-with-acid filter, Fennell must have used it. And who knows what was going on while she was dreaming up the story."
"Fennell gives us such great dialogue in “Saltburn,” but not an inspired story. Though that’s certainly fun to watch, particularly among a large theatrical audience that’s game for it, it leaves a lot to be desired."
"Although Saltburn is let down by a third act that is interesting but contradicts everything that came before it, you have to stand up and salute a film that's so eager to have ""weird"" and ""horny"" be its key descriptors."
"[Keoghan has] his own charisma, which he plays [close to Alec] Guinness. A little bit of rough. Then an hour or so in, you get the shape of what’s happening."
"If the film's aggressive appetite for transgression eventually begins to feel like affectation, well, there is an awful lot of good unclean fun to be had on the way."
"There’s no rhythm to the film, no sense of buildup and payoff. There are occasional perverse pleasures... but there is little satisfaction to be found in the picture’s messily uninhibited climax."
Fennell has led us down the corridors of Salburn’s maze but with all the twists and turns it seems everyone has gotten lost along the way
"The most sublime and rewarding subversion of the mythical straight boy unicorn trope. Emerald Fennel delivers a film whose opulence borders on fantasy and whose excess borders on the absurd in all the most rewarding ways.
"
"Saltburn salaciously romps through obvious psychological machinations, orgiastic revelry, and ruthless elitist culling. Efforts to shock, disgust, and titillate devolve into banality. There are few surprises in a film that broadcasts its intentions."
"Mr. Phoenix’s Napoleon could never have commanded so much as a squadron of the Salvation Army, and though the movie is sprinkled with a few reasonably hearty battle scenes, overall it’s something like Mr. Scott’s Waterloo."
"Instead of rushing out to theaters to see Napoleon, find a documentary or History channel special. Chances are you will not only learn more, you will be more entertained."
"Ridley Scott's polarizing biopic is not very interested in precision, nor in trying to understand one of the greatest figures in European history. But it's very fun. [Full review in Spanish] "
"... A Napoleon for dummies that shows some facets and important facts of his life on a basic level, but wrapped in virtuoso cinematographic garb. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Napoleon thrives when these masterfully crafted battles are coming to life in the most epic way possible. The movie feels messy on occasion, but there is plenty to admire."
Let weird Joaquin cook!
"Though short on insight into a controversial historical character full of contradictions, the interesting casting for the lead role and the brilliant, bravura treatment carry the day"
[Scott's] new two-and-a-half-hour epic is as rudimentary and as passionless as CliffsNotes. It’s akin to a bored professor teaching from a droning study guide.
"Is it a Gladiator? Absolutely not. But, you know, it's hard to be another Gladiator."
That brings us to the battle sequences: they are out-of-control great.
"I found it impressive and kind of startling at times, but I was not emotionally moved."
"What Napoleon lacks in newfound insight, it makes up for with some well crafted sequences and Phoenix and Kirby’s dynamic chemistry."
"What is this movie meant to be? It moves at gratifying speed, but looks rushed and downright dingy at times—an especially disappointing point, because if Ridley Scott is hardly given to introspection, he is nimble at making surfaces shine."
"Although masterful battle scenes abound, at the core of the film is Napoleon's mercurial fascination with Josephine. Kirby is sublimely layered, while Phoenix is creepily unhinged. It’s a portrayal of a relationship unlike any you’ve ever seen."
"Ridley Scott delivers a spectacular but flavourless French history lesson.

"
"A huge display of pageantry on the battlefield and human squalor in the bedroom. Magnificent to look at, Vanessa Kirby shines as the manipulative Josephine, Joaquin Phoenix mumbles and murmurs as the lead."
A deeply flawed work filled with flashes of brilliance surrounded by poorly paced and half baked connective tissue that never really allows its stronger impulses to blossom.
A constant criticism about Ridey Scott’s movies is that they have more style than substance. Napoleon is a prime example of this.
"The Napoleon-Josephine relationship sits awkwardly alongside moments of spectacle, physicality, and dramatic scale."
"The story of this Corsican gunnery sergeant, a quintessential outsider who brought Europe’s kings to their knees, probably has something to tell us about today’s political landscape. Too bad Napoleon doesn’t find it."
"As the film progresses through its nearly three-hour run time, it never finds a balance between the epic and the intimate, and I walked away feeling like I have not gained any insights into Napoleon or what made him tick."
"The film does a poor job at cohesively fusing Napoleon’s personal and political lives, which all versions of history tell us, bled into each other."
The film has a running time of more than [2.5] hours. Even that is not enough to look at both the career and personal life of Bonaparte. Scott should have picked one specific area and focused all energy into using the allotted time to tell the best story.
"If film fans trek to their local cinema, the meticulously staged war sequences, played like chess games, will keep them intrigued."
"Volumes have been written about Scott and the lasting effect his visual sense has had on contemporary big-screen entertainment. Napoleon belongs in the front rank of his creations, alongside such landmarks as Blade Runner, Alien and Black Hawk Down."
"Almost everywhere you look, a risk is being taken that stands next to no chance of paying off."
"While the underdeveloped plot isn't a minor issue, the magnificent scenes on the battlefield elevate the film to a privileged place in the director's filmography... [Full review in Spanish]"
"The best thing about this Napoleon can be found in the scenes that reproduce the intense relationship between Bonaparte and his first wife, Josephine. [Full review in Spanish] "
"This is not the movie to watch if you’re looking for precise breakdowns of Napoleonic politics or strategy. ... It is, rather, more like a farce, a look at the absurd vanity of greatness."
"Scott knows how to stage spectacle like few other directors. The battle scenes are jaw-dropping, from cannonballs tearing through flesh to soldiers slipping into freezing water during the infamous invasion of Russia."
I feel like Ridley Scott and Joaquin Phoenix dislike Napoleon too much to actually make a film about Napoleon. 
"Phoenix is a wonderful actor, but seems miscast to the point where you wonder if that was the point. "
"Soulless, messy, and flat (that's just Napoleon's sex moves). Ridley ripped the dynamite from the name and chucked it at the historic figure, but Napoleon is a bit to choppy to call a masterpiece as it's more like the director's Waterloo."
"Despite falling short in critical areas of maintaining a compelling pace and gripping storytelling, Napoleon is a noteworthy addition to the genre of historical epics, with engaging performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby."
"If Phoenix is quietly mesmerising, Kirby is combustible."
"But the battles give us more spectacle than thrills, more action than suspense, leaving Kirby's charismatic, finely layered performance as the film's strongest asset. Kubrick would probably approve of her. After 116 takes..."
"Napoleon gets a jolt in its final hour from the appearance of Rupert Everett as the Duke of Wellington, one of the British military commanders...But by the time he shows up, it’s too late..."
"Ridley Scott's big-budgeted character study is an epic bore! Without charisma, Joaquin Phoenix is almost as creepy & quirky as he was in 'Joker,' while Vanessa Kirby, despite her alluring decolletage, lacks sensuality. It's a colossal Waterloo-ser!"
This sprawling biopic doesn't seem to know what to make of the iconic French emperor.
"His willingness to play with the conventions of the genre, even with a mega-budget production, is precisely why this biopic is so refreshing, as Napoleon is very much a repudiation and a revolt against history’s “Great Men.”"
"A visual feast that combines the spectacular nature of the battles, a recurring element in the director's filmography, and the charisma of its protagonists. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Writer David Scarpa has some fun digging into the characters, creating people who are fascinating, funny and also a bit scary. It's a thunderous film that's far more entertaining than expected."
The junction of this sort of brutal and ultraviolent classicism with an actor in his prime makes Napoleon a colossal film. [Full review in Spanish]
"Napoleon was one of the most fascinating people in history. Unfortunately, for all its big-budget set pieces and stars, Scott’s film is underdeveloped and confused."
"The result is a colossal bore that is never passionate, exciting, sexy or entertaining—save for exploding horses with their guts blown all over the landscape."
"Napoleon showcases how imperialism, misguided destiny, and the inferiority complex of nation and man alike leads to death and destruction.

Ridley Scott is in top form. Not many filmmakers have such a command on their craft as him."
"This one is for everyone who loves a historical epic, and believe me, fans of this genre will have a lot to feast their eyes on. But! This is a flawed film, and its flaws are highlighted by the fact that when it is good - it’s actually pretty amazing."
Scott has always worshipped at the feet of strong women... David Scarpa’s unabashedly steamy screenplay is the first to make the perverse dynamics of Bonaparte and Josephine’s tortuous on-off love affair fully explicable.
"Napoleon is protracted, as if running time and rambling narrative incidents amounted to substance. Napoleon parades an empty spectacle for a market uninterested in learning from history."
One can’t help but wonder how much more enriched the entertainment scene would be if producers like Apple lavished their moneys on upcoming talent rather than the old guard.  
The journey through these three and a half decisive decades in the history of the West dominated by Napoleon has a few holes and we will have to wait for Scott's promised four-hour streaming version to cover them. [Full review in Spanish]
"What Scott has done with this film is develop a narrative that is more fictional than historically accurate, in which he portrays Napoleon as a brilliant but insecure man; ambitious, but dependent and even obsessed with his wife. Full review in Spanish."
"This might bother some, but for me, Scott’s mythologizing of an already heavily propagandized life was crucial to what makes Napoleon work when it’s firing on all cylinders. "
"Napoleon was a weepy, masochist, a so-so general who was forced to be emperor. He loved only one woman and cried when he divorced her. He wanted Josephine instead of an heir for the Bonaparte dynasty. France will not forgive Ridley Scott for the insult."
"Napoleon, in reality, tells nothing, investigates nothing, proposes nothing. [Full review in Spanish]"
The big problem with Napoleon is that it lacks the depth that the character deserves. [Full review in Spanish] 
"Historical inaccuracies are the least of it's problems. The problem with Napoleon, by Ridley Scott, is that he has no idea what he aspires to be. [Full review in Spanish] "
"Though there are brilliant moments, in general, I'm assailed by coldness or indifference to the story I'm being told. [Full review in Spanish]"
"For all the film's refusal to canonize its protagonist, it doesn't have terribly much to offer beyond its mocking portrayal of the former general, and the peppering in of expansive battle sequences in between."
"It does have the feel of a film that’s been scissored to death. The battle sequences are spectacular but the jackhammer cutting-style -- hang on, how did he get from there to here? -- means the storytelling is hurried and confusing."
"The show must go on, and this is why the battle scenes are the best thing about the movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A noble attempt that doesn’t fully succeed, even as it leaves us some memorable imagery. What it’s missing is that human insight is essential to tackling any kind of historical giant."
"We see the raw power of cannonballs, men and horses plunging into a frozen lake, Moscow aflame and much more. Scott has always been adept at depicting both the chaos and tactics of warfare. "
A historical biopic that’s more interesting than moving.
"Phoenix does brilliantly throughout Napoleon, always keeping enough complexity flickering across his face to fill in the gaps where Scarpa's dialogue is floundering."
"With terrific performances and incredibly well-shot battle sequences, Napoleon is a good, competently made feature, but it's messy plot and obvious gaps in the narrative stop it from being great."
"It makes for an awkward, disjointed epic with flashes of brilliance and flashes of utter nonsense. "
"Much of Napoleon still works thanks to Scott’s guidance. The whole may be a mess, but the individual parts are often commendable.     
"
"Even with all its flaws tallied and noted like battlefield casualties, there’s still something mildly compelling about it."
"The duties of physically creating the film seem to have left Scott no time to contemplate what he wants to say. This director has never exhibited a strong individual style, but here the absence of a point of view is maddening."
"What Scott and Phoenix have done with Napoleon is nothing short of historical vandalism, and it’s a pleasure to watch."
"Napoleon is close to three hours long, but it never feels slack; there is vitality as well as elegance to its flow, highlighted by huge battle sequences that each have their own distinctive character."
"Napoleon is even better as a sex comedy than it is as a violent spectacle, which is really saying something..."
Scott has situated a historical war epic inside a bedchamber melodrama for a put-down of male power. But his 158-minute narrative is shapeless.
Veteran director Ridley Scott unleashes his own Napoleon complex in this uneven but never less than thrilling account of the French military leader and dictator.
"His 28th feature is the culmination of many years’ immersion in the subject matter, and while it takes one or two liberties historically, it might be Scott’s most satisfying epic since Gladiator."
“Napoleon” lands with an epic thud as opposed to just being epic. That’s disappointing for anyone who had this one circled on their calendar for the holiday movie-going season.
"Strong technical elements and violent artistry salvage this uneven historical biopic of Napoleon Bonaparte.

"
"It’s a shame for a film cautioning us about one of the most famous megalomaniacs, they forgot about the guy beside him"
"""If there’s any psychological abyss separating Napoleon the needy man-child from Napoleon the brilliant strategist, the movie is content to merely gaze across and not into it."""
"Despite its famed director and star leading the charge, Napoleon feels more slapstick and befitting an under two-hour runtime. Instead, the film deluges audiences with an unnecessary tale of an unnecessary ruler. "
"As epic in scale as Napoleon is, the film feels cold and removed from the man himself."
"However well-staged the various battles are, this aspect of his story amounts to not much more than a superficial skip through decades of history that had me joining Napoleon himself in wishing that we were back at home with Josephine instead."
"It’s as unique as a snowflake, or as a strike of lightning. Dreary for its time and deranged for all of time."
"In the end, you get your money’s worth in extravaganza and cannon fire but not nearly enough of the charismatic personalities and bravura filmmaking a project this gargantuan needs."
"One hopes the promised director's cut of Napoleon will feel like a more complete experience, where the magnificent battlefield sequences serve to complement the character-driven storytelling, rather that overshadow it. "
"Napoleon is a disappointment, attempting to cram an abundance of information into its 160-minute runtime. Sadly, this results in a choppy narrative tangle. Nevertheless, the film’s visual allure on the big screen is undeniable."
"Phoenix’s performance in the title role is carefully calculated, a deceptive turn in which he initially seems to be channeling Buster Keaton, disengaged from all that’s swirling about him. "
"Napoleon is unimaginative, uninspired, and unrelentingly dry."
"Outside of the scale and epic action, there are shortcomings to be found in its muddled tone and pacing, meaning this fails to come up as one of Scott’s best. "
"It relies far too often on the “little man, big temper” idea of Napoleon — at times, Phoenix is practically channeling an angry Donald Duck mid-meltdown — and the scenes between the two lovers make them seem more like robots emulating human beings."
“Napoleon” without a convincing Napoleon is not bound for glory.
"Although the film has its share of high points, there are more misses than hits, resulting in a 2 ½ hour experience that provokes frustration at a missed opportunity."
"“Napoleon” is consistently surprising partly because it doesn’t conform to the conventions of mainstream historical epics, which is especially true of its startling, adamantly unromanticized title character."
"The strength of the movie is in the visuals and filmmaking. Joaquin Phoenix is one of our greatest actors, but he feels miscast here."
"Overall, Napoleon is another example of Scott’s shining work as a director. It’s rough around the edges, but it works as a whole. This movie is monumental, gorgeously shot with brutality and a fierce nature that pulls you into the experience."
"Ridley Scott isn’t the filmmaker you go to for nuance, but nuance is just what’s needed when talking about Napoleon."
"While Napoleon is ultimately worth a mild recommendation because it’s a visual marvel and performances, the narrative ultimately fails to live up to the fascinating life of its subject."
"Napoleon is an interesting film. Not because of the story or characters but more the fact that I enjoyed this overlong, historically questionable tale. It's worth, at the very least, a stream down the road."
"This visually dazzling period epic creates a narrative conflict almost as contentious as the many battlefield clashes it depicts. Unlike its subject, the film survives its missteps."
"The best way to describe Payne’s ninth feature is to say it’s remarkably ordinary. A quality that applies to most of his films that are warm, quiet, and inherently funny meditations about unexceptional people leading a simple life."
There are so many touching and subtle scenes in this film. So well done. 
Alexander Payne has created a wonderful holiday movie about finding a sense of family and caring for others in the least expected places.
Paul Giamati's performance is a master class in acting.
The wit and the warmth just can’t grapple with the overbearing runtime.
Has a new Christmas classic been born? [Full review in Spanish]
"In The Holdovers, Payne has managed to maintain that same keen-eyed insight, but without the sense that the film itself is an active participant in the torment. It’s a rare and remarkable balance to hit."
"A wry, artful heart-tugger."
Paul Giamatti is a grinchy teacher in Alexander Payne’s loveable answer to The Breakfast Club.
"In heartfelt fashion, however, this festive-adjacent film isn't simply a comedy of teens running amok while Giamatti chases, ruler in-hand. That exists too, but only insofar as it allows us to recognize how similarly damaged Paul and Angus truly are."
"Even when the script is hammering home its points, the performances keep the characters multidimensional."
Legitimately one of the best Christmas movies ever made. It's also the perfect Wes Anderson movie for people who don't like Wes Anderson. 
"If only The Holdovers had some of its actors’ bonafides. But overall, it feels painfully phony."
"This, for me, is foundational Alexander Payne... It's his best work since Sideways."
"The Holdovers doesn’t miss a beat in examining the sadness churning around the holidays, topping it off with the kind of melancholy yet restorative ending that hits right where it needs to. "
"Buoyed by a lovingly laid-back pace, gentle dissolve shots and meticulous attention to period architecture, dress, mood and music, ""The Holdovers"" feels like IT was held over – from 1970."
"Before you finish your leftovers, take in 'The Holdovers.'"
It’s one of those movies that you just want to go on forever because you never want to leave.
Payne has put together a tonally satisfying fable in which people watch each other carefully and wait for them to reveal hidden layers. 
"This year’s feel-good winner bubbles with humor and positive change as Payne, transforming an intelligent cerebral script into a captivating film, showcases his storytelling prowess and the power of well-executed, character-driven narratives."
"The structure of The Holdovers is certainly a familiar, but Payne dons it like a warm, well loved coat."
"Perfectly combines subtle humor, laugh out loud moments, and a chemistry between the two leads that we haven't seen on screen in quite a while. This movie offers up a whole lot of heart, and is a must watch Christmas movie."
"Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa and Da'Vine Joy Randolph give excellent performances in this comedy drama about grief, love and chosen family. "
"Giamatti delivers one of his best performances to date, making The Holdovers a perfect family watch despite its very saccharine story."
"It represents a triumphant return to film for Payne after the disappointing “Downsizing,” but it also works (almost) perfectly as a measured, occasionally emotional, beautifully acted drama, shot in a very 70s style. Full review in Spanish."
"The appeal here is in the dialogue (especially Giamatti’s: “Listen, you hormonal barbarian…,” “I find the world a bitter and complicated place – and it seems to feel the same way about me”), the character development, the acting ... "
I absolutely love slice-of-life movies. The Holdovers is one of the best in years.
"The snow-covered landscape, Christmas setting, a jazzy folk score by Mark Orton, and wonderful performances by Giamatti, Randolph, and Sessa, make this a must-see! “The Holdovers” is destined to become a cherished holiday classic."
While The Holdovers conjures warm and nostalgic storytelling with its ’70s found family spirit and trio of outstanding performances — especially Da’Vine Joy Randolph — its emotional impact is stunted by its fractured focus.
"Call it a return to form or whatever you want. I’ll just enthusiastically say that even with its few minor issues, “The Holdovers” is one of Payne’s best films to date."
A dramedy about three people reframing sadness and loneliness during the holidays.
Easily one of the best Christmas-themed entertainments in some time because it sustains its brilliance and never resorts to gooeyness.
"[T]his is the movie that Payne’s been hoping to make since his 90s heyday, a film that earns both its jaundiced gaze and its catharsis."
One of the year's best films also makes a strong case for the top spot in director Alexander Payne’s impressive body of work.
"Payne’s forte of capturing the humanity in conflicting relationships is apparent in his works. Such is the main drive and the fun found in 'The Holdovers', where we see Payne reunites with Sideways‘s Giamatti. "
I thought it was really terrific and... I think this will be a movie that you'll want to go back to and and revisit.
Paul Giamatti [is] so good in the subtlest ways.
"Fine performances from Paul Giamatti, Da’Vine Joy Randolph and Dominic Sessa, but something about it left me cold. "
"Sly in its humor and sincere, though obvious, in its poignancy, human dramas of this sort have become increasingly rare, in the superhero era of cinema. As such, the film may seem better than it actually is."
"There's not a false beat, and it's not a feel-good movie, it's a feel-great one."
"This movie works on so many levels; from the very real and relatable story, Paynes poignant direction, to the beautiful snowy setting, the perfectly placed humor, to the wonderful and world class performances. It’s a delightful holiday instant classic…

"
It starts out like a misanthropic Goodbye Mr. Chips and ends like a pessimist's take on It's a Wonderful Life. But before it's over Alexander Payne's The Holdovers exhibits a humanist's love of its characters.
"While The Holdovers has all of the elements of a period piece, the heart of the film is the same as his present-day tales as it shows Payne’s ability to create smart character-driven social satire."
"It may not be the future of filmmaking, but for two hours at least, the past has rarely felt more present."
"The Holdovers reunites Giamatti with his director from Sideways, Alexander Payne, and he gives what might be an even better performance."
"Earthshaking, no, but Payne and company have crafted one of the year's best films, so give yourself an early holiday present and don't miss this humorous, heartfelt paen to compassion for ourselves and each other."
"“The Holdovers” is a movie for people who want to spend some time with relatable characters simply trying to navigate the vicissitudes of life. In that, it’s a breath of fresh air."
"...about the hard, hard work of small acts of kindness."
"Like “Green Book,” “The Holdovers” shows us how drastically life has changed, yet emotions haven’t. It's a great trip to the past and a perfect look at how we can improve the future."
"This analog tale with a snappy script and grounded characters provides the warm hug that its audience needs, reminding us that a makeshift family can give a person what they need in the absence of a real one. "
"Alexander Payne's touching, bittersweet comedic drama is one of the best films of the year. - Director Payne, screenwriter David Hemingson, along with actors Paul Giamatti & Da'Vine Joy Randolph, should score Oscar nominations."
A genuinely funny and poignant film packed with the qualities of a holiday classic. Payne capably balances comedy and tragedy seamlessly in ways that feel honest and relatable.
"This exactly the type of theatrical film that we were told Hollywood would not be making in the post-pandemic era: a non-franchise, character-driven, middling-budget drama aimed at adults. Thank goodness, at least in this case, the pundits were wrong."
"In its own way, the first runner-up for the coveted ""People's Choice Award"" at September's 48th annual Toronto International Film Festival actually brings in the 2023 holiday movie season.
"
This is a darkly humorous character study into self-isolation and self-destruction that presents the warmth of dysfunction.
"Wry, funny (with some zingers that will stay with you long after the film is over), and closely observed, The Holdovers is my kind of Christmas film."
"Those are lessons that seem to resonate a little deeper this time of year, which means now is the perfect time to accept an invitation from The Holdovers."
"The Holdovers could make a great play one day. For now, though, it’s just a deeply pleasant movie."
"Stands as a celebration of the quiet, everyday heroism that shapes our lives, reminding us that sometimes the most profound connections are forged in the unlikeliest of places."
"Sour but also weirdly cloying, full of sympathy for the working man yet also strangely pretentious. A nostalgic tribute to naturalistic 1970s cinema that somehow completely misses the point of those movies."
"This subliminal familiarity with the theme, setting, and situation decisively contributes to making the audience feel good, along with the ending, which is partially predictable but perfect, and satisfying in every way. [Full review in Spanish] "
"Paul Giamatti gives his best performance since Sideways, reteaming with director Alexander Payne for a melancholic Christmas classic in the making.
"
"In his latest film, Payne foregoes some of his trademark cynicism and goes straight for the heart, resulting in a touching seasonal film for people who aren’t that jazzed about the holidays."
"Payne's best since Sideways; the entire ensemble deserves praise for bringing it their all. A lovely, melancholic Christmas story; it almost feels more like a live-action adult version of what Charlie Brown goes through. A must-see for this time of year."
"In the dramatic comedy “The Holdovers,” the director lets in the sweetness just a little bit. And that’s splendid. "
"Payne and Hemingson have created a well-paced, witty, film with just enough physical comedy for Giamatti and Sessa. We could see The Holdovers become a new holiday classic to be held over year after year. "
"Giamatti has a ball here as a glass-eyed grump, but he’s a known quantity. The lupine Sessa is the revelation; it’s a gutsy move putting him in a movie theater scene watching Dustin Hoffman, but it’s no accident."
" Whatever leftovers “The Holdovers” serve up, Payne and his once-and-future-muse Giamatti make this cinematic comfort food perfectly palatable."
Payne's first-ever period piece is an unconventional holiday film that stars the always-wonderful Paul Giamatti.
"“The Holdovers” is Payne and Giamatti at their very best. A must see, an instant classic, something for everyone."
"For me, it stands as a minor if beautifully crafted film in the context of Payne’s entire oeuvre, but a potential classic of the miserable-holiday subgenre."
"Can be thought of as Payne’s response to people who complain that they don’t make movies the way they used to...a funny, insightful film, deeply humane and ultimately quite touching."
"Though Giamatti has never not been a joy to see on-screen, he is on another level here, bringing both the necessary comedic timing and dramatic gravitas to hold The Holdovers together. "
"A calmly paced movie that allows its characters space to breathe, think and express themselves in their own manner. It’s a narrative not in any hurry to go anywhere but to revel in comedic moments of character."
An old school slice of comfort and joy for the cold season.
"The Holdovers is perhaps a touch on the schmaltzy side, but it earns that schmaltz through great performances, a sharp script, and a director with an eye for finding beauty and meaning in the ordinary."
The Holdovers is so good that it’s infuriating that Payne hasn’t made more movies than the eight on his filmography.
"The result mixes charm and smarm in equal measure, never quite resolving into a meaningful exercise, despite the strenuous efforts of all involved."
The Holdovers is a brilliant study of an all-boys school and the troubled men it produces.
"Christmas films often deal in the joy/annoyance of family during the holidays, but Payne takes viewers in an entirely different direction in tone and spirit."
"Nothing about The Holdovers sounds particularly special, and yet it’s one of director Alexander Payne’s best films -- very funny, occasionally touching and a sterling example of the bonds that can be forged by an unlikely family."
"Like Payne’s and Hemingson’s characters, The Holdovers will shift your worldview from meaninglessness into wholesome over 2 hours and 13 minutes. This nostalgic coming-of-age tale delivers a full-circle emotional expedition for young and old."
"It’s a Christmas movie as uplifting as the saddest of Christmas songs, and as full of hope against all odds. "
"A sweet nostalgic character-driven film that is elevated by contrasting personalities that result in well-timed comedic and often, heartfelt humor."
It could very well have been a recently discovered lost film being released in theaters for all to see.
"Characters in The Holdovers have an assortment of disabilities—some of them normalized, but some that border on cliche."
Alexander Payne has delivered one of the best movies of 2023 - a film you will love to discover and share with others.
"The movie's greatest achievement... is that it has taken a terribly familiar story and has magically managed to tell it in a way that feels fresh and organic, even with the holiday stuff included. "
"The Holdovers does feel right; its characters feel real, its emotional beats feel earned, and, yes, its faux film grain feels authentic."
"Despite a bit of surprising preciousness, This film is exquisitely performed & its themes of redemption over loss are well played. This has all the requisite wistfulness of a traditional Christmas movie, without any holly jolly. Payne! Giamatti! Reunited!"
"It’ll fall into my holiday film rotation, one that the whole family can enjoy without being put off, depressed, or bored. A fresh, impactful, and very funny drama about finding sanity in the unlikeliest of places."
An incredibly funny and deeply moving film that strikes a damn good balance between coziness and harshness. With a great period setting and fantastic performances. A must see!
"Yup, it’s a big, gift-wrapped present filled with sentimentality and lovely, effective performances, expertly crafted scenes, and a terrific story."
"Poking fun at the stuffiness and affluence of high-brow academia, this character-driven saga of redemption and self-discovery is bittersweet and quietly profound, sprinkling in nuggets of humane wisdom beneath its familiar surface."
The Holdovers is perhaps a bit on the poky side; little in the story gives much urgency to the pace. But the actors bring their connections to life.
Audiences will value the time they’re allotted to spend with these characters as they confront some of the most difficult moments of their lives.
"Nearly 20 years after Alexander Payne and Paul Giamatti teamed up for Sideways, they’re reunited for the wintry character study, with Giamatti once again turning in masterful work as a hard-tippling misanthrope..."
"Finds every avenue to make these characters collide, collude, and refract one another in a dizzying display of heart, humanity, and humor."
"The Holdovers seizes a familiar sensation, one as fleeting as the first snowfall in autumn, and reminds audiences of the emotions that good storytelling can evoke. "
"For what might be the finest film of his career thus far, The Holdovers, Alexander Payne has achieved a pitch perfect balance between his trademarked usage of cynicism and sentimentality."
"An entertaining installment that may not be quite as good as the originals, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes definitely stands on its own merits and charm."
Were we champing at the bit to learn how Donald Sutherland’s Machiavellian President Coriolanus Snow schemed his way to power in the years before the original The Hunger Games
Needs no more installments.
"Years after the young-adult dystopia genre crested and flattened, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is here to remind us of what we are missing: not much."
The best film in the series — but that’s still not saying much.
"The action scenes remain well-shot and tightly edited, and even without the provocative political energy of the Katniss years, the cultural parallels between Panem’s world and ours retain their unsettling power."
"""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a film of contrasts — visually stunning yet narratively uneven, it offers a fascinating glimpse into the origins of Panem, but not without stumbling over its own ambitious intentions."
I do not buy it philosophically for one second.
"It is very long and sometimes unwieldy, but in the hands of director Francis Lawrence... I think fans will like it. It delivers mostly the high notes you expect from a film of this sort."
"A standout leading lady isn't quite enough to rescue Songbirds and Snakes from sluggish runtime, bizarre pacing, and muddled thematic elements, but Zegler's fire (combined with some memorable costuming and action set pieces) lends this film some spark."
Absolutely zero chemistry between the two leads.
"The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is enjoyable and recaptures the essence of the series. Can be bloated at times but the performances and script carry the film home.

Themes of oppression, dystopia, and societal inequity are relevant to today’s injustices."
"The film is compelling and dark, and benefits from an impressive cast including Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage, plus evocative production design and some gut-wrenching twists."
"It’s really just a tired rehash, albeit an extravagant one, this time with less appealing characters. As dystopias go, it’s a real bummer."
"This time, the music plays a central character that makes this prequel all the more welcome."
...the ruthless intrigue of a post-war Capitol is a brilliant allegory for how the scramble for power ultimately makes spectacles of us all. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a villan origin story you shouldn't miss.
"This is a strong movie filled with excitement, tension, and drama that will keep you watching. The performances are excellent, the screenplay is fantastic, and Lawrence shines again as a superb director."
A fascinating character study of a villain made not born... Collins has graduated to an entirely new level of storytelling in this genre: an introspection into a single character whose fate is known... easily the best film of the series.
"The Hunger Games: The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes stumbles in adaptation from book to film primarily in the structure, and while it also runs too long, it's not a bad return to this world for those familiar with this franchise or those who know nothing."
"A strong addition to the franchise - though the need to justify the existence of the story is a fair discussion to have, especially without further sequels currently lined up. If potential future stories can be as strong as this, however, count me in."
"The story here is strong enough to stand on its own, but of course, it is a prequel, and there is a grimy pleasure in seeing the clunky early iterations of the later Games’ slick social machinations."
"I didn’t expect to walk out of a Hunger Games movie with a roots music buzz, but I’m not complaining!"
"Essentially the “Star Wars” prequels of the “Hunger Games” world. But while George Lucas took three movies to show us Anakin’s fall into darkness, Lawrence and screenwriters Michael Lesslie and Michael Arndt try to do it in one overstuffed installment."
"Viewers have already seen these narrative machinations and limited themes leeched for every ounce of meaning across the original series, but here we are again, chewing on the exact same discursive material like a cow with their cud. "
"'The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes' makes it through as becoming one of the more memorable films of 2023. Despite its languish pace and a hard-to-sell romance, it’s action-packed and worthy of recognition."
"If you've not read the book, or seen the previous movies, you won't get as much out of it. The first 2/3 of the movie is slow, plodding, and violent. The 3rd act becomes more interesting as we see the arc of Rachel Ziegler character, along with Snow's. "
"Overall, there's plenty to appreciate about the movie -- the performances, the production design, Nashville producer/songwriter Dave Cobb's music supervision, and the many Easter eggs and references for Hunger Games fans. "
"Though the nearly three-hour runtime certainly seems daunting, the characters and music, to say nothing of the tense, action-packed event that is the Hunger Games, drive this film forward and deliver a powerful tale from a beloved universe."
"Surrounded by stellar performances from a cast committed to bringing Snow’s origin to life, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a magnificent prequel to a franchise that ruled over the big screen over a decade ago."
"'Songbirds & Snakes' won't make you feel any more resentful of the fact that fictitious barbaric competition exists inside this world, but perhaps it will make you understand why it was able to grow into the thing we know in later stories."
"As before, director Francis Lawrence remains faithful to Suzanne Collins' novel, with high-quality filmmaking and solid performances. But there's little air in the story, as the script races along with an over-serious tone."
"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes isn’t bad...But when the entire point of the movie is to be an origin story for a villain, that part of it should work better than anything else. And, in our minds, it’s the opposite."
"Praise Davis, Schafer and Schwartzman, who understand the film they're in and embrace it. Blyth is afraid to let Snow be a villain so the romance between him and Zegler only works during the games. Overall, this is fine, but too long, especially Part 3"
"The prequel is much more layered than the Jennifer Lawrence films. Actor Tom Blyth is mesmerizing in the role with deep, soulful eyes that convey his thoughts and feelings. Viola Davis also shines as the mad scientist who shapes Snow into the President. "
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. It’s deeply mesmerizing and engrossing. You will not be disappointed in this trip to the Districts.
"Full of standout performances from the entire cast and an affecting story about the lengths people are willing to go to not just for survival but for power, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is an impressively haunting character study."
The richest and most meaningful film of the entire franchise. A heartbreaker with beautiful highs and devastating lows
"Yet [Coriolanus Snow's] links to the story’s future aren’t enough to make him fascinating here. Thank goodness for Rachel Zegler, who plays a woman fighting for her life."
"For a dystopic action drama with a ""modest"" $100 million budget, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes looks good enough. Paces itself well enough. And pretty much always strives to just be enough. And for me that’s also enough."
"At every turn, the film makes a strange choice either in screenplay or filmmaking to undercut itself."
Solid return to Panem. Most of the movie delivered what I was wanting. But this feels like a rare example of a film which would have been better served split into two films. The odd structures causes the film to run out of momentum long before it's over.
Director Francis Lawrence does an incredible job with this novel adaptation and Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler have electric chemistry in this Hunger Games prequel. 
"It’s haunting without losing the balance of its sappy romance and battle royale shenanigans. It sparks renewed enthusiasm for a more mature audience, providing focus on the story’s astute power dynamics and the unraveling of bureaucratic hypocrisies."
I’ve always found The Hunger Games to be more than passable entertainment for a franchise that I paradoxically thought did nothing particularly well. 
"Strong performances, melancholic melodies, psychologically twisted storytelling, boldly biting scenes, fantastic aesthetics and production value make 'Songbirds and Snakes' a vigorously engrossing and victorious return of “The Hunger Games.”"
"Despite its racial diversity, the film employs the safe but shallow ""colorblind"" approach that blunts its positive effects."
"As far as pointless prequels go, this one kept me interested without pandering to the previous entries in the series. Not amazing but definitely a solid 1-time watch."
"Nothing leaps off the screen, few things feel dire, little happens to make us truly care about the characters or their situational struggles."
"Despite the socialist rigors and humanitarian wrongs, it feels good to be back in Panem, a world that rolls deep like a familiar melody but slithers slyly with a new tale of forbidden love, opportunistic alliances and a deadly game."
"The new addition to the saga entertains, but only scratches the surface of what could have been an interesting transformation."
Davis’s deranged games designer Dr Volumnia Gaul and Jason Schwartzman’s showboating compere Lucky Flickerman justify the price of admission.
"While I’m pretty sure Lionsgate bankrolled the project in the hope that another title under the Hunger Games umbrella might be profitable, the production is of comparable quality to the earlier releases even if its need to exist is questionable."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes doesn't feel like a rehash. The story centered on young President Snow is pretty captivating.
"Despite Tom Blyth's best efforts, this film can't deliver a compelling villain origin story. This is yet another unneeded, underwhelming, and uninteresting prequel trying desperately to keep a franchise monetizable. "
"Tom Blyth is a revelation as the complex young Coriolanus Snow, delivering one of the best performances of the year, [while] elevating important pieces of The Hunger Games lore to new heights."
"In a pivotal scene in this banal, dull, boring prequel in which poisonous snakes are slithering all over her, the heroine bursts into song, making me want to stuff a sock in her mouth!"
"A highly entertaining film with the signature, luscious costumes and sets, this ""Hunger Games"" prequel nevertheless stumbles with the uneven story of the franchise's main villain's origin story"
"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes never surpasses the original Hunger Games films, but succeeds as a return to the world of Panem, full of propaganda strategizing, brutal violence involving teens, and a splash of romance."
"If you push the tired prequel tropes aside, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a rather triumphant comeback for The Hunger Games franchise..."
It fails to validate its existence beyond the Hollywood routine of squeezing every dollar out of a successful franchise. It doesn’t really add anything to the overall narrative. It’s just… more story. And for no reason at all.
"…just about works as a stand-alone film, with obvious symbolism and sharp pretentions that few blockbusters can offer… doubling down on the dark, vain-glorious reasons that a well-meaning man might find himself fast becoming a new Hitler for his age..."
"""Ballad"" may be bloated, but it understands that The Hunger Games, as a franchise, didn’t succeed because it had a clear political philosophy. It succeeded because it entertained."
"It was long but sharper than expected, esp. Rachel Zegler as Lucy, who had an edge to her survivalist and performed a singing angle to great effectiveness. And Peter Dinklage can do more with a raised eyebrow than most actors can do with grand speech. "
"At 157 minutes, it’s overlong, but Blyth and Zegler have chemistry and real acting chops, and his not-so-heroic journey is a nicely nuanced portrait of how someone started out before breaking bad. "
"If, like me, you are a fan of the first films and books, it is enjoyable to be back in this dystopian world. Even if you are not quite sure why."
Some muscular central performances and a firecracker finale nudge this Hunger Games prequel away from the worst instincts of the franchise.
"Rather than splitting a book into two dull, overlong, and bloated films, they’ve just made one dull, overlong, and bloated film."
"All up, the film is among the more laboured and contrived than the series. There’s not much wit in it."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a great follow-up to the earlier films and works very well on its own. It might be the best crowd-pleaser of the Thanksgiving season.
"[O]ne of the most exciting, emotionally arresting entries in the franchise."
"[Viola] Davis and [Rachel] Zegler steal every single frame they’re in, chewing up the scenery and delivering such amazing performances as to not be forgotten for some time."
"If you bought into the first four instalments, then you will doubtless have fun, but it seemed to me to go on for ever..."
"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes wants to make a point about how Panem divides Snow and Lucy, but as serviceable as Blyth and Zelger are as performers, their actual love story needs to be believable for us to notice."
The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is the result of [Hollywood's] financial ambitions. [Full review in Spanish]
"Prequels are generally trash, movie musicals are messy, and villain-centric narratives are almost always disturbingly sympathetic to wretched ideals. This is a villain-centric prequel with enough singing to count as a quasi-musical. It’s somehow great?"
"This latest installment in the dystopian fantasy franchise emphasizes spectacle over substance, rehashing many of the same plots and themes with fresh faces and a few familiar names."
"This is a dour, depressing tale about an expanding dystopia, centered on a protagonist who’s learning how to prosper in a dog-eat-dog world.  What’s not to like?     "
"Far better than anticipated, Francis Lawrence’s “Hunger Games” prequel, “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” proves to be a worthy addition to the franchise, one that reminds us of what made these stories distinctive among the rash of YA dystopian novels,"
"Remarkably, Songbirds & Snakes has found a way to make the Hunger Games feel new and sharp."
The film should have ended at the two-hour mark and saved the last material for another film where the dramatic shift the characters make could be expanded to a more understandable level.
A mediocre prequel that feels even longer than it actually is due to the baffling structural decision of adding a third act that feels like the second season of a tv series. [Full Review in Spanish]
"This Hunger Games prequel provides intriguing performances and some insight into the early days of Panem, but fails to keep the momentum throughout."
Francis Lawrence's Return to Panem takes us even deeper into dystopia through the youth of President Snow: the youth of a leader we all love to hate. [Full review in Spanish] 
"""The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is two-thirds of a crowd-pleasing grand adventure that gets bogged down by the obligations of being a prequel."
"Overindulgent...a bloated origin story...
"
"This grittier, more intimate realization of Panem compels. When the turnstiles into the arena cheerily chirp “enjoy the show”, the franchise’s dichotomy of spectacle and savagery is underscored with renewed resonance."
"Luckily, the intrinsic force of the events that transpire prevents the film from sinking at any point, but the idea behind the story is a thousand times more powerful than the way it's executed. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Reservations aside, the most important aspect to this film is that it makes me curious and gets me excited about what comes next."
"The Hunger Games is back on the big screen, but prequel adaptation The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes can't quite scale the heights of either its source material or its cinematic predecessors."
Completely unnecessary and mostly lifeless prequel. Davis is only saving grace.
"It’s another heady mix of teen romance, glamorous frocks, dark comedy, gruesome slayings and social commentary."
"Adaptations, particularly those based on books that primarily use inner dialogue, are difficult and although this picture hits all the novel’s major events, there is definitely something lost in translation, which could leave some viewers in the dark."
"At nearly three-hours long, the movie gives you too much of some things and not nearly enough of others. Still, for all its flaws, at least critics can't say, ""It didn't follow the book."" "
"I wouldn't say that Songbirds is dreadful, but like its lynchpin performer Jennifer Lawrence, it probably should have moved on. What's the point?"
"Readers, fans and followers of the series will certainly get more out of the film, but even those who are completely unfamiliar with the Hunger Games franchise will appreciate this movie for what it is—a compelling dystopian fantasy."
"I'm taken by its attempt at being the Lawrence of Arabia of YA movies, and its exploration of how tyranny is fuelled by self-preservation and how people condone state-sanctioned violence out of fear and desperation. That conversation really hits today."
Franchise fans looking to revisit this world will get enough to make it worth it. For everyone else: Leave when the Chapter 3 title card appears.
"It’s a risk doing a prequel to this hit film franchise without the power engine of star Jennifer Lawrence and the safe and sorry result, set 64 years before Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen ever drew breath, is seriously overlong and underwhelming. "
"Its 2-hour-and-37-minute runtime starts to drag by the end. This is mostly due to the fact that the film sticks too close to the book. The action takes place in the first two-thirds, and then we get a sort of extended epilogue."
It looks like no Katniss is no problem for Songbirds And Snakes. A fine blockbuster adventure for autumn
"On the basis of its half-thought-out script, Hollywood writers’ fears of being supplanted by artificial intelligence appear well-founded. This movie seems proud, even smug, about recycling scraps from other fairy tales."
"Wish features plenty of classic Disney nods, a great performance from DeBose, and two solid musical numbers. Unfortunately, this story feels rushed, scattered, and extremely familiar. The villainous arc goes nowhere, and the spark is somewhat missing."
… a centennial production that manages to do what Disney have repeatedly struggled with and properly tap back into that sense of wonder and childlike joy that audiences to this day associate with the studio.
Disney once upon a time provided outstanding movie magic for the entire family. Sadly that time has passed.
"Ironically, in its desire to celebrate Disney magic, Wish fails to generate any magic of its own."
"For anyone looking to feel the magic of Disney, there are at least 50 better options available on Disney+. "
"At a breezy 95 minutes, Wish doesn’t overstay its welcome and kids are sure to enjoy the cute critters and slapstick set pieces. Older fans, however, may realize their true wish is to see something else."
Do you remember when a Disney animated feature film was an event? I sure do.
"The animation is ugly, the story is confusing, the characters are an unappealing jumble of badly-expressed traits, the voice acting is meager, the songs are an affront."
"Despite the passive nature of his foul(ish) scheme, Magnifico is Disney’s best villain since Tangled."
Wish can be described as the cinematic equivalent of the gift shop you’re forced to walk through at the end of the ride. It’s not the worst movie that you will bring your kids to but the obvious goal is to vacuum up more money for the mouse.
"“Wish” isn’t original or all that entertaining. It’s what you sit through while you wait for the parade to begin.


"
"When all is said and done in the world of Wish, the brightest features of the animated story are DeBose and Pine’s performances, bringing their talent to Asha and King Magnifico, respectively. "
"Despite the weak soundtrack, Wish works because of its strong continuation of the Disney mantra, a warm animation style and a very fun wink and nod to so many past Disney productions."
Lovely Andalusian visuals and an extraordinarily talented voice cast elevate this Disney animated feature that is otherwise just meh. But Disney enthusiasts will have a great time noting the nods to the classics.
"Harboring inventive visuals and a heartrending message, Wish has enough heart going for it. What a shame, then, that it wasn’t confident enough in itself to try for success without these clichés."
A feature length greatest hits reel that makes you wish you were watching something better.
"Maybe the House of Mouse’s century of achievement merits some sort of celebration, but Wish isn’t really it. ... This feels like a faded facsimile of past Disney glories."
"If you put a bunch of executives in a room and told them to put out a list of what elements you have to have in a Disney feature, this is what you'd get. "
"Everything positive about Wish entertains and feels good, but we've definitively seen it before in another Disney film. [Full review in Spanish]"
Do not Wish upon this star-crossed Disney animated musical.
"One can understand how some will view all of this with great cynicism, but come on: Wasn't there a time when you wished upon a star?"
"It's possible to catch the zeitgeist express and still suck, and here's the proof: Fawn Veerasunthorn and Chris Buck's flaccid, disturbing, Les Miz-for-kids Disney flick, Wish."
"From the fantastical fairy-tale setting to the blandly designed characters and contrived plot, nothing feels very original. But there's plenty of charm to keep us watching, a few enjoyably nutty moments and some terrific voice work from an ace cast."
"Sweet enough, but it won’t get its wish of being a Disney"
"It follows the studio’s fairytale formula: plucky heroine, villainous magician, talking animals, and big songs. Yet the story brings no new life to the parade."
"Wish is engaging and heartfelt but weaves between familiar themes.

The voice acting was strong and a couple of songs are definite standouts.

It doesn’t hit the highs of the studio’s 90’s renaissance era but serves as a solid tribute film."
"Just like The Marvels, Wish is an emotionally inert and personality-free movie that appears to have been assembled from the outside in. "
"With lacklustre animation and forgettable songs, it tries desperately to be a new Frozen but falls many snowballs short, despite a decent voice cast..."
The old and the new go hand in hand in a film that serves as a culmination and summary of 100 years of existence. 100 years of magic. [Full review in Spanish]
"For a film that spends much of its time talking about magic, it's too bad that Wish displays so little of it."
"I'm aware that it seems like I've hated Wish from everything I've said so far, but the real feeling is disappointment. [Full review in Spanish]"
There is much skillful work present in this movie but it offers nothing new. Nothing is dared and everything feels manufactured.
"There are things to like in WISH, including Tudyk’s slightly pompous baby goat, some stunning backgrounds, and Star’s playful good cheer."
For a film that’s meant to sum up a century’s worth of groundbreaking animated feature production — the song “When You Wish Upon a Star” is even baked into Disney’s corporate logo — Wish plays more like a collection of deleted tracks than greatest hits.
"It feels like Disney were so focused on a paint-by-numbers tribute to their fantasy musical movies that they forgot to sprinkle on the magic. Despite this, there are aspects of Wish to be praised and enjoyed..."
"The film is let down by an underdeveloped plot that fails to flesh out Magnifico's reasons for going on a wish-crushing rampage. The film is undoubtedly full of magic, hope and nostalgia, but it ultimately falls short of classic status."
"The movie is so busy referencing the classics, it makes itself an afterthought."
"Wish, the newest Walt Disney Animation Studios feature, celebrates 100 years of magic and wonder by bringing the Disney nostalgia."
"It would be churlish to criticise Disney for making yet another kid-oriented musical when Wish, Encanto and the Frozen films are of such uniformly high quality."
"The songs are knotted, entirely forgettable, and the iffy watercolour/computer animation hybrid gives Wish an awkward, unfinished look. Pity."
“Wish” is a basic fairy tale that knows its audience and plays to it without guilt.
"The company’s latest is not so much a film as it is a highlight reel of their greatest hits, a Disney expo turned Easter egg hunt that rewards even the most casual fan."
Disney celebrates its centenary with a grimly cynical marketing exercise wrapped in the sparkly cloak of an escapist animated fairytale.
"This time, I let the audience do a smidgen of my work for me. They applauded at the end of the movie."
Wish doesn't quite has that ineffiable something that makes a traditional Disney classic but it certainly makes up for it with its self-aware exploratiion of the dangers of idealism.  
"A lifeless, focus-grouped attempt at throwing back to the classics."
"You can probably guess how things turn out in ""Wish""; one thing about assembling a new movie from parts of old ones is that it's going to have a hard time surprising us. But that worked — for me, at least — because nostalgia is the point of the movie."
"This fairy tale feels more like a corporate product than a magical event; it’s a limp dissertation on Disney’s motto that, “When you wish upon a star, your dreams come true.”"
 ‘Wish’ reminds us to celebrate the magic in life's simple joys and the enduring power of hope.
Wish has a very ambitious premise. It's too bad that everything else about it is bland and generic.
"Beautiful visuals with bland, forgettable music, no amount of fairy dust on the screen could magically turn this mediocre Disney movie into a magnificent one."
"Wish takes its inspiration from the idea of “wishing on a star,” which became a central theme in Disney’s marketing. And to be honest, Wish feels less like a movie and more like a marketing campaign to celebrate Disney’s 100 years of animation."
Wish reminds its audience what makes classic Disney so special - and that it can’t be replicated. 
"Wish, the new Walt Disney Animation Studios picture, is a warm and winning animated film that acts as an origin story for the studio’s legendary filmography."
"""Wish"" is actually more interested in spending 95 minutes reminding viewers of Disney’s greatest hits. "
"Wish is a beautifully animated homage to classic Disney, but the film in front of us is weighed down with the baggage that all of the modern Disney movies seem to have.

"
"Wish may not be the grand spectacle for the studio’s 100th anniversary, but it is still an enjoyable and enchanting feature that serves as a throwback to their classic era. "
"Wish celebrates the hundredth anniversary of Disney Animation Studios in the only way it could be done: with music, magic, and inviting us to dream. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Where oh where is tried and true superstar Mickey when the home team needs him more than ever?
"As Disney animation enters its second century, “Wish” hearkens back to the past and points the way to the future, all the while telling an enchanting story about how important it is to hold on to your dreams."
"The film will do well enough. But its backwards glances serve only to remind us how transcendent Disney animation once was – as recently as Frozen – without offering any hopeful signposts to the future. But, yes, cracking songs."
"The built-in nostalgia should appeal to fans as a centurial celebration, and aficionados will get a kick out of spotting the hidden tributes to the older movies, but the film is stuck in looking in the rearview mirror."
So determined to be a Disney movie that it forgets to be a good movie.
"Looking beautiful but tonally inconsistent, musically meh and generally lacklustre, Wish isn’t going to ascend to the giddy heights of the classics it references."
"Not the animated gem that presumably the studio wished for its 100-years celebration, but a serviceable dose of magical star dust that will surely entertain kids and satisfy Disney super fans. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"It’s tuneful and well animated, but “Wish” only wishes it were as good as previous Disney classics.

"
"If I judge Disney’s latest for what it is and not for what it may have been, I find it very difficult to tell potential viewers to stay away."
"Stunning that this is getting negative feedback ... this film seems like a culmination of everything Disney has given us for five generations. and what is necessary in a holiday movie, a retreat from the sorrow in the world, if we just WISH upon a star!"
Wish might just be the most generic movie I've ever seen. 
"All in all, this movie could have been a lot more than what it was worth, but it was almost as if it didn’t even try and only exists as a placeholder for Disney to say that we did this on our anniversary."
"It's easy to watch and often entertaining, but it doesn't leave a lasting impression."
"…while Wish doesn’t have the ambition of Disney’s best products, it should engage the hearts and minds of holiday audiences for long enough to make a buck as its unspools a breezy, uncontroversial narrative of falling stars and unrequited dreams…"
"Wish feels like a throwback to classic Disney that may divide or appeal to fans, young or old. Nonetheless, its effortless charm and beauty drive this touching ode to the animation studios."
Unfortunately falls short when compare to the rich legacy of the studio. Its tribute to 100 years of Disney animation & several fun songs aren't enough to make the film stand out or be memorable. A flat riff on the studio formula. [Full review in Spanish]
"Nevertheless, the cynic in me wonders if Disney’s reliance on their formula, just in time for the holidays to endear a whole new line of toys to their loyal fans, makes the film lack the luster that “Frozen” and “Encanto” did."
"A love letter to classic Disney animation, this offers a sweet balance of traditional themes and child-like hope."
"Disney's Wish is an enjoyable, festive celebration of Disney magic and history. It's a cute film with good songs, music, and a lovely, unique visual aesthetic. Chris Pine makes for a great oily villain."
"Some people complain about the commercials before the feature presentation; here, the feature presentation is a commercial."
"Wish is a Disney fairytale set in a world that isn’t derived from a fairy tale source. The lore here is adapted from old Disney product, and the fairy tale references are to movies based on folk tales, not to the folk tales themselves."
"Has assembled its entire plot from bits and pieces of old Disney movies, which causes everything to be held at a remove, and it’s clear that serving a century of Disney IP is more important to this film than storytelling is."
"Wish doesn’t necessarily shine incandescently, but there’s enough of a glow that it’s worth giving a go."
Feels like a script ChatGPT spit out using Disney prompts. 
"Well, it’s a big swing, anyway, even if it’s a miss: Disney’s latest animated effort goes full Carl “We Are Star Stuff” Sagan and takes aim at the Judeo-Christian God."
"Wish doesn’t quite reach the stars, but it does shine intermittently while introducing another plucky teenage female heroine, gamely voiced by Ariana DeBose."
A collection of tropes with a good singing voice.
"A distinctly lesser contribution to the Disney animation canon that, like its combination of 2D and 3D styles, tries to blend the old and the new but winds up uneasily straddling the line between them.  You’ll leave wishing “Wish” had been better."
"This particular animated feature seems to pander both to diversity and to Disney's centennial celebration. The results are some good visuals, costumes that are definitely cosplay-worthy, but a story that fails to be emotionally moving."
"So I make this wish, to have a better film for us than THIS."
"While the intention may have fallen in line with celebrating 100 years of Disney, I’d be hard-pressed to believe this film will be among those fond memories."
Ain’t no magic here. 
“Wish” seems less like a movie and more like one of those picture puzzles where you circle all the hidden objects on the page.
Wish leans into the company’s strong association with fairy tales and original songs to tell an original story...The result is a heartwarming and celebratory confection bursting with deftly handled easter eggs to the studio’s past work.
"Wish manages to be none of the things it wants to be. It is neither evocative enough of the past to work as a tribute, nor irreverent or inventive or just plain funny enough to justify its constant but half-hearted callouts."
"For a century now, Disney has made its multi-generational audience feel like partners in the mysteries of movie magic. I just wish 'Wish' had a bit more of it."
"It’s strangely “off” in many ways and the result, although possibly still accomplished enough to capture the attention of children, is easily Disney’s least appealing animated musical in the post-Little Mermaid era."
Really does end up feeling like Disney is going for the bare minimum with audiences...
"After a series of misfires that seriously threatened the House of Mouse, I am proud to report that, with “Wish,” Disney is back!"
"A loving tribute to 100 years of Disney, filled with references and inside jokes to the studio's history. It is also a commentary on the dangers of absolute power and the revolutionary role of the people. [Full review in Spanish]"
"[Star] really shines, creating an unexpectedly uplifting narrative by inspiring so many of the characters to do what’s right — including the many animals that it grants the ability to speak, which results in cuteness overload and hilarity."
Anatomy of a Fall (2023) is a compelling courtroom drama and a deep examination of long-term relationships' dark and dirty corners.
"Through it’s thrilling and profound screenplay, words are dissected and their multiple meanings laid bare in a courtroom drama that is exhaustingly detailed and meticulously executed..."
An endlessly gripping pseudo-murder mystery with confusion and uncertainty becoming the center and lifeblood of the film.
ANATOMY OF A FALL is a riveting courtroom drama under the phenomenal and precise direction of Justine Triet. Sandra Hüller is sensational and makes this a MUST WATCH.
"A masterclass from start to finish; the courtroom scenes make up some of the most riveting cinema in recent memory, but it's the scenes of martial strife at home that really linger."
"Rather than an exercise in ambiguity, you could instead read the movie as a story which—slowly, with methodical care—refuses to embrace the usual Hollywood narrative conventions about women, criminality, and culpability."
‘…offers a novel twist on the classic courtroom thriller form…’
"Thanks to the commanding film-making, this art-house crime mystery earns – and deepens – every minute of its hefty runtime."
"For all of its slow pace and restraint, Anatomy of a Fall remains a singularly ambitious film that is one of the strongest courtroom dramas in recent memory, and so much more besides that."
"Rightly considered among the best of the year, this is a film that will provoke heated discussions long after the credits have rolled."
Anatomy of a Fall isn't a movie for those who want definitive answers; it's for those who are more interested in asking questions as they turn the story this way and that.
Justine Triet draws out a very simple story to create ample ground to reflect upon what we're watching. [Full review in Spanish]
"Hüller is magnetic in the central role, and we want to believe her even when the evidence suggests reason for doubt. "
The bombshell revelations send you running this way and that.
A beautifully observed breakdown of a fractured and failing marriage told under the guise of a murder mystery/courtroom drama.
"At its heart is Hüller’s performance, a haunting and emotional tour de force that stays long in the mind and puts her right up there in the top tier of European talent."
Anatomy of a Fall is challenging and enthralling work which keeps the audience guessing and deliberately scrutinises the notion of guilt and innocence.
"Ultimately, one of the key pleasures of the picture is its uncertainty – the niggling doubts that remain, and the sense that a crucial piece of the puzzle is tantalisingly out of reach."
"It’s confident, classical filmmaking, yet despite its many formal and thematic pleasures, doesn’t offer a whole lot that’s new."
Hüller’s impenetrable poise is such that Anatomy of a Fall bleeds into an anatomy of her cool.
"It’s hard not to be drawn in. That’s the trick of Anatomy of a Fall. Sandra is a fascinating, one-woman puzzle box, thanks largely to the strength of Hüller’s performance. "
"The film that remains, for most of the final reel, is inevitably one about the brutality of intimacy. Sober, mature film-making."
"Anatomy of a Fall is a beautifully constructed elliptical drama, constantly demanding our close attention as we ponder the protagonist’s innocence or guilt."
If you like a film that keeps you guessing until the end -- and perhaps beyond -- then get yourself into the public gallery for this case. Powerhouse director Justine Triet has kept you a seat beside her.
Grips you every second of the way and leaves you endlessly mulling over the events.
"A hyper-realistic French legal drama, as well as a deeply intimate discourse on the dissolution of a difficult marriage. Gripping, beautifully-acted, a bit pretentious, and almost painfully naturalistic."
The result is an impeccably crafted courtroom drama with some heavy moments meant to jumpstart our imagination.
"The film keeps you guessing right to the end, and questioning everyone."
"A death can be pinned down, as here, by details of blood spatter and snow melt. The forensics of life are harder to know."
"This is a film of intelligence and dimension, marked by a wry sense of humor, and shaped by a thoughtful awareness of human complexity and the faulty systems we have in place to understand it."
Hüller is a virtuoso at conveying a strong personality through a self-contained shell.
"Surprisingly gripping for a film devoid of real action, this family drama masquerading as a murder-mystery touches on universal marital tensions; it is both enigmatic and very human."
Anatomy of a Fall is easily the most attractive and entertaining courtroom drama in recent years and represents Triet’s best work.
The question is no longer guilt or innocence. The film is more concerned with the reasons people — and the state — commit acts of violence and our responses to this violence after it occurs.
"Triet’s filmmaking is precise, but the real tension comes from the gender and marital dynamics. While I wish that we saw more of them rather than simply speculated, Anatomy Of A Fall is a thoroughly entertaining and thought-provoking drama. "
"There are gripping moments here, but even they are muted as Triet takes pains to not let the viewer off the hook and perhaps intentionally dulls the senses with the convoluted, overlong court sequences."
"... It’s the plot of Basic Instinct and it’s not quite clear if Triet is paying deliberate homage or attempting to pull a fast-one on the audience. Either way, Hüller’s performance is riveting."
"Anatomy of a Fall works brilliantly as a Hitchcockian thriller for today, but it has depths and resonances beyond the genre. We all construct our stories; they’re always partial; we never fully know each other. "
"Anatomy of a Fall, while showcasing a stunning use of the film medium, is a social experiment. The film isn’t about a death at all. It’s a mirror held up to the audience."
"...the picture, aside from Hüller’s admittedly outstanding work, generally comes off as a garden-variety legal procedural."
An exploration of how isolated moments and other small things can stack up to present a warped view of reality.
"Anatomy of a Fall exists to be debated. A vibrant masterwork composed only of gray, it exploits ambiguity to expose our inherent, unspoken prejudices about relationships, gender roles, parental responsibility, and justice. "
The courtroom drama serves as a backdrop to unveil each fascinating layer of the dissolution of a marriage with Hitchcockian precision.
"In the eye of the tumultuous legal storm, not only does Hüller give another formidable performance that looks us dead in the eyes, but she excavates resonances from quieter moments where her character's protective mask begins to ever so slightly slip. "
"I never would have guessed that the esteemed Cannes Film Festival champion, the crowned art house jewel, would leave me with 50 Cent's “P.I.M.P.” stuck in my head. I didn’t have that on my bingo card."
"Despite being awarded top prize at the world’s foremost film festival, it feels more like one of those prestige cable miniseries that your co-workers are always going on about on Monday mornings."
Anatomy of a Fall [is] a compellingly human and sneakily philosophical courtroom drama...
"...about the subjectivity of observation, experience, and memory."
"This is an expertly made film... But if you think too much about it, the whole thing falls apart."
"Emphasizing ambiguity and taking a literate approach, Triet’s engrossing film doesn’t revolutionize the courtroom drama, but it’s an unusually layered and intelligent example of the genre."
Anatomy of a Fall is an engrossing deconstruction of a marriage that Justine Triet structures with diligent precision. 
"The movie is less a murder mystery than it is a depiction of the way the legal teams play with their subjects like chess pieces. They move, counter, block, and move again... Very little of it has anything to do with the truth. "
"At its heart, “Anatomy of a Fall” is a highly entertaining endeavor rivaling “Gone Girl” with its suggestion that a rocky marriage might be a viable motive for murder. "
Huller rises and delivers the best lead actress performance of the year so far.
"Justine Triet is challenging us, in a suspenseful frenzy, by interrogating what we believe “truth” really means."
"Anatomy of a Fall is one of those fascinating films that doesn’t stop at the end credits but will be completed, in a sense, by people hashing it out in the theatre lobby or on the car ride home."
"Despite laudable writing and ensemble-wide acting, Triet’s direction rarely injects the proceedings with anything resembling noteworthy filmmaking."
"A gripping courtroom drama that works magnificently when the camera remains in the courtroom, and one level below magnificent when out. "
"The question of “Did She Do It?” will continue to be asked as Anatomy reaches a wider audience. I don’t suspect an answer will be agreed upon, but the fact that the question is being asked means that the film is a success."
"Where ambiguity can frustrate and spoil less artful movies that rely on uncertainty as a kind of gimmick, “Anatomy of a Fall” uses it masterfully, weaving a mystery that will provocatively endure. "
A gripping French courtroom drama with a marked affection for American pop culture.
"It might not break any new ground structurally, but this twisty French drama benefits from stellar performances and crackling dialogue in unspooling a murder mystery that probes deeper into the nature of relationships."
Triet approaches so many elements from slightly askew angles that bend just enough to support conflicting arguments.
It’s an extremely thoughtful and provocative film that employs a unique approach to examine a failing marriage.
"A clear and clean Palme d’Or winner, every ambiguity and “unexpected” choice so carefully thought-through that awards can’t help but be thrown at it. "
"Triet's script, which she co-wrote with her IRL partner Arthur Harari, is always pushing forward, pulling and peeling back new layers as it goes, and going deep inside the fraught, underlying tension of Sandra and Samuel's marriage."
"My only problem with “Anatomy of a Fall” is, at two hours and 32 minutes, it is just too darn long. "
Sandra Huller in dazzling  quicksilver turn.
"Don’t let the 2.5-hour runtime intimidate you, this masterfully executed courtroom thriller soars by with brevity."
"If it sometimes feels a bit contrived, and if its conclusion will leave some viewers unsatisfied, Triet has made a film that succeeds brilliantly — on terms that are as exacting, rigorous and precise as her unflappable heroine."
"Anatomy of a Fall is a great family drama, a great courtroom movie, and a great film overall, and deserves to be on the list of the best of the year."
"Anatomy of a Fall is a thrilling dissection of death, but more compelling is what else is learned on the path to the truth. It's a suspenseful, hang-on-every-word barnburner with powerhouse performances
"
"If you liked Gone Girl, this might be a movie that really you would dig."
"It's two and a half hours long, but it's so engrossing and it really evolves, because you think it is one kind of genre and over time it morphs into something else. And the ending is just perfect."
Anatomy of a Fall is a slow burner of a film and deserved winner of the Palme d’Or this year.
"Based on what the viewer sees and learns along the way, the numerous facets of Sandra’s case are open to interpretation, with known facts coming with different kinds of emotions and motivations that are capable of explaining any number of theses. "
"Justine Triet puts the audience in the jury’s position with no clues to sway us in either direction, therefore the audience is absorbing every detail. A thriller in the true sense of the word with a knockout performance by Sandra Hüller."
"The complexities of the narrative are utterly riveting, raising some eerily big questions about human nature while telling a story that's packed with huge emotional kicks."
Triet’s perceptive views on marriage stick to the ribs. The performances do too.
"Triet creates tension from her first image, that of a ball bouncing down the stairs, where it will be retrieved by Snoop, the dog who in many ways represents the deceased…"
 The film is especially urgent in our current climate of instant black-and-white judgment and immediate and certain character assassination. The film argues for nuance...It's an exceptional work.
It’s a fascinating movie that nevertheless ends without quite addressing all the issues it raises. Everyone and every scene are more than watchable—often gripping—yet there’s ultimately a narrative vacuum in the conclusion.
A gripping procedural from beginning to end that can be a tad obvious at times with its deconstruction on how to tell a story.
French director and co-writer Justine Triet’s engrossing courtroom procedural centred around a commanding performance by Sandra Hüller makes the minor objections to the film inconsequential. 
"What makes this elegant, gripping crime thriller unusual is that the pot never boils. "
Watching the case unfold is emotionally trying as one can only imagine being put in a position to defend words said in the heat of the moment or refute subjective accounts of your personality and actions. 
"Anatomy of a Fall may not reinvent the wheel, but it’s still one of the most sharply made courtroom dramas in recent memory. "
Sandra Hüller’s landmark performance in Justine Triet’s psychological study of marriage is simply stunning. 
"A finely crafted courtroom drama, Anatomy of a Fall finds plenty of tension in the threads that both bind people together and pull them apart."
"Anatomy of a Fall provides no easy answers. With exquisite timing, filmmakers Triet and Harari paint a narrative portrait as complex and multi-layered as life itself."
"With surgical precision, Triet and co-writer Arthur Harari’s script exposes nearly every contemporary relationship schism you can imagine."
"Anatomy of a Fall may test some viewer’s attention spans as it slowly layers detail upon detail, both procedurally and personally, but for patient audiences it offers up an interesting mystery and an opportunity to examine personal biases."
"An intelligent, adult examination of a marriage gone sour, wrapped up in the trappings of a legal thriller, Anatomy of a Fall is anchored by a performance of airtight ambiguity by Sandra Hüller."
"Triet’s approach to telling this story is decidedly tasteful; she layers one subtly intriguing detail atop another, like a muted accumulation of snowfall."
Anatomy of a Fall needs no dissection to understand why this is sure to become one of your favorite films of 2023.
"The acting — particularly by Huller, Theis and Milo Machado-Graner as Daniel — keeps us invested throughout while Simon Beaufils’ shadowy cinematography expresses the chill of a relationship. "
Anatomy of a Fall is an intoxicating courtroom drama with meticulous filmmaking and masterful performances. 
"In a nutshell, what Anatomy of a Fall sets out to achieve is also its greatest undoing: the larger-than-life aura of capital-C cinema that backfires as pretty bluster."
Justine Triet's courtroom drama-thriller Anatomy of a Fall choreographs a riveting dance between tragedy and the transference into survival mode via the manipulation of reality and the power of invention.
"It has both suspense and intellectual ambition; plot revelations don’t just send the story in new directions, they expand the film’s cultural scope."
If this movie has taught me anything it’s that video game movie adaptations will never be a sustainable avenue for Hollywood.
"What will be most frustrating for fans of the video game franchise and distributors Sony is that the film fails to deliver the same level of quality as its source material, though newcomers might find more to enjoy."
"Tom is a solid Nathan Drake 
Sophia is a great Chloe 
Mark was Mark…. Nothing against him but he was nothing like Sully. 
As a long time fan of this gaming series I wanted more & left frustrated even with the fun glimmers that were throughout the film "
What started as a video game produced by Play Station became a movie that just doesn’t hit all the notes it desperately tries to. 
"Uncharted is an action-adventure flick, but despite a more entertaining last act, it fails to break the curse of videogame film adaptations due precisely to the lack of said action and adventure."
"With a predictable plot, rudimentary puzzles, and strawman characters, Uncharted never manages to find its narrative bearings."
"Uncharted fails to provide the most basic principles of an adventure movie. It is underwhelming and overloaded, without the charm of its clearly Spielberg-ian roots."
Uncharted heads into familiar action-adventure territory making for a forgettable video game adaptation.
"While Uncharted rarely veers away from the charted territory, the film has enough fun with itself for an enjoyable ride."
"If you squint hard enough, you'll see what makes Holland great—charm, charisma, aw-shucks levels of approachability—but none of it saves the flick from being utterly forgettable."
Uncharted seems fresh in the era of superhero blockbusters. Saying it’s not as great as one of the best video game series ever shouldn’t be a massive indictment as it’s a fun ride with a clear respect for the source material.
A globe-hopping adventure that manages to be visually boring and charm-sucking.
"It’s a fun ride, and there’s a cool cameo for gamers to enjoy, but it is not quite the film I had hoped it would be."
"“Uncharted” really leans on its star power, especially Holland who plays a very Holland-like character – charismatic, boyishly charming, a bit daffy, and with an unshakable innocence (even when he tries to talk tough). "
The film's secret weapon is Tom Holland's natural athleticism.
"If you are after a relatively generic action-adventure, Uncharted probably fits the bill – although a Marvel-like reliance on digital effects does let down its larger action sequences."
"Amidst the lukewarm broth of deepfakes and green screen that make for the main entertainment of this film, there are very few fun, memorable moments except for the most stupid ones, and we'd rather forget about those. [Full review in Spanish]"
"There's just enough that gleams here to be watchable. It's a film with a few shiny coins in its bag, rather than a whole bar, cavern or ship of riches."
Uncharted plays out like a very middle-of-the-road treasure hunt movie which emulates the likes of Indiana Jones and National Treasure and comes off as an uninventive re-tread.
There have been worse movies this year. Maybe even this month. But I'm not sure those are more unnecessary than this one.
This film will not have you returning to it time and time again.
A new [kind of] bland brand movie prefabricated to fit into the superhero film panorama... [Full review in Spanish] 
Given the sorry history of movies based on video games -- there's last year's rollicking Werewolves Within and then there's everything else -- Uncharted is probably better than it had any right to be.
"I don't know anything about the video game... but I A) was able to follow it, and B) I had fun watching to it.... They took the very basic background of the video game and they just told a story."
We now have enough data to state unequivocally there will never be a truly great movie adapted from a video game.
... Ends up being an entertaining yet disappointing film. [Full review in Spanish]
"Despite the big names attached, it completely lacks identity. 
[Full review in Spanish]"
It turns out to be a somewhat entertaining adventure romp that is not quite light enough in tone. Holland and Wahlberg have good screen chemistry together and they make for a winning pair of adventurers.
"Entertainment without pretense.
[Full review in Spanish]"
"It’s the kind of film which relies as much on fun characters being clever as it does the action, harkening back to the adventure stories of our, or at least this reviewer’s, youth."
The blandest action-adventure movie seen in some time. If only we could press the “reset” button. 
"A limp and crude film about a search for lost treasure that feels more tiresome by the minute, so much so that it makes Tom Holland completely devoid of any charm; pallid, insensible, and uninvigorating. "
"Nathan Drake might not sport a bullwhip or fedora, and he might avoid raiding tombs, but the beats of his adventures are as old as some of the treasures he seeks."
"Fleischer knows his way around a snappy action sequence, but this is all pretty generic, high-flying/low-stakes middle-of-the-road stuff, slickly made and perfectly watchable and all the more boring for it. "
"There certainly was action AND adventure, it's just neither element was particularly exciting."
"iUnchartedi really wants to be iRaiders of the Lost Arki. So badly, in fact, that it's hard to believe there weren't snakes in the hold of Magellan's wrecked ships."
An entertaining story with watchable characteristics. Not a perfect film but good enough to invest me in a possible sequel. 
"The laughably atrocious screenplay is perpetually buoyed by the film's tight pacing and strong cast chemistry. Though it often seems to have happened completely by accident, Uncharted manages to be a pretty entertaining summer action flick."
"Uncharted aims for old school adventure with a modern sheen, but the end result is the latest in a long line of immediately forgettable video game adaptations."
"...a slick adventure thats been suffused with a whole host of unappealing, by-the-numbers elements..."
"While Uncharted will never be a classic on par with Spielbergs original swashbuckling adventures, it does no dishonor to that tradition, and even manages to deliver a few unique thrills."
I like Tom Holland in movies like this. I wish the the action was a little a bit more exciting.
"Uncharted emerges as a disjointed mess of a movie that cant decide if it wants to be full-on video game fun or slick cinematic treasure hunt, leaving Holland swimming upstream against the current of a story thats as choppy as it is uninteresting."
"It is wildly ironic that the only references to the action-adventure films of the past that Uncharted mimics with any skill are the ugliest, most outdated elements."
Its not poorly written for a video game-based movie. Its poorly written for a ransom note. Its poorly written by the standards of online comment sections. Its poorly written compared to an Ayn Rand novel. Its that bad.
"The best you can say about it is that it's bad, but in surprising ways."
"The vibe of it is a little bit of throwback. It feels like the sort of silly, fun action movie we got a lot of in the 90s."
"It is not path-breaking. It is also not as cinematic as its source material. Once that is clear and the pressure on the film to be perfect is off, it becomes easier to see Uncharted for what it is: a harmless action movie that does its job. "
"There's not much depth to the film as it's meant to be frivolous fun, which it is."
"Uncharted is aimed squarely at gamers, although they're likely to be sent running back to their PlayStations for something a little less bland."
"Here's the deal. If you have somehow never seen an Indiana Jones movie, Uncharted might well blow your mind. If you have seen one, then you've basically already seen Uncharted."
The film doesn’t forsake its dialogue and emotions for action. It strikes a perfect balance which makes it a wholesome entertainer.
"What’s perhaps most disheartening is that Uncharted, which is meant to be about Nathan Drake, doesn’t seem very invested in him at all."
As flavorless and routine as they come.
It is kind of soulless and thats how youre likely to feel coming out of it.
"While it disappoints as an adaptation of it's source material, there's enough big budget set pieces and star power to make for a fun adventure.  "
"This is a fun first step, with Holland and Wahlberg proving to be a delightful pairing."
There's just not enough story that matters.
Delivers what you expect - a fanciful adventure movie where you just sit back and enjoy the ride.
"It's certainly easy enough to just sit back, turn off any higher functioning of the old brain, and just go with the flow. And there's something to be said for that."
"Casual moviegoers will enjoy this generic treasure-hunting action film, while fans of the video game series will most likely come out disappointed. Full review in Spanish"
"Many of the film's flaws are forgivable because it doesn't take itself too seriously. ... If you're looking for an action adventure unburdened by a coherent story, Uncharted might tide you over until the next superhero installment."
The storytelling can be kind of lame and derivative of better cinematic art; the gameplay itself can grow tiresome in the more unfocused moments...
"It's not that much of a movie, but a diversion. It's a big, dumb diversion; the best thing about it is that it serves as evidence that Tom Holland makes for a wonderful movie star."
"An entertaining adventure film; nothing special, but nothing offensive, either. However, ""Uncharted"" fans will probably be left with mixed feelings. Full review in Spanish."
High-quality popcorn entertainment in the tradition of the National Treasure and Pirates of the Caribbean series.
"If you haven’t yet, play Uncharted 4, or watch a let’s play of it as though it were an animated film. The reasons for which it’s better is so immediately apparent."
The result is serviceable but soulless.
"Uncharted bites the dust -- and cobwebs -- in a passionless, generic Raiders knock-off."
Uncharted reeks of cynicism and presents an inept understanding of its source material. 
"A fun, rollicking adventure flick with likable protagonists, fun puzzles and big set-pieces -- what’s not to love? Isn’t that basically the gist of the games?"
"It’s all mildly amusing, mildly exciting and entirely routine, just as you might expect from a director such as the reliably faceless Ruben Fleischer (Venom), who manages to go from one hit to the next without ever showing any particular talent."
"Holland is very funny...it's so much fun, and it sets up for a sequel."
"Uncharted seems like it’s a film that knows what it’s meant to do, and that’s to entertain. Which it does well. It’s not the next coming of Indiana Jones, but it’s an enjoyable 116-minute ride. "
"The term aggressively mediocre applies to many video game adaptations, but we also do not need further exhibits for people to convince us that the National Treasure movies are good because others are lamer."
"Now that another great franchise has failed to live up to the hype, theres even more evidence that what makes a movie succeed and what makes a video game succeed may be mutually exclusiveno matter how much DNA they seem to share."
"My favorite movie genre is action adventure, and its rare to find a big studio film that gets it as right as iUncharted/i. I loved it. "
"It's an Indiana Jones wannabe, video-game style."
"I have sat through far, far worse video game movies, and Uncharted is at least basically competent."
"Fleischer keeps the energy up with a solid build and momentum. Its starts off with the street-smart logic and sleight of hand tricks leading up to an all-out crazy, special effects heavy climax that defies logic."
"Uncharted is not bad enough to hate and not entertaining enough to engage with. Its just another bad video game movie.
"
Theres nothing original about this treasure hunt movie but Tom Hollands knack for action and the character's chemistry is enough to retain your gaze.
"For fans of each of treasure hunter Nathan Drakes incredibly convoluted adventures, this movie is likely going to feel like a bona fide disaster."
"For the non-purist, this might work as easy consumption popcorn fare."
Uncharted is bland and disappointing without being outright disastrous.
"Director Ruben Fleischer has a good eye for buzzy, well-framed action sequences and scenes that move until they run out of road, which is perhaps the best way to describe this film: a race car stuck on a very short track."
"It achieves the primary goal of based-on-a-video-game movies, which is that the non-stunts parts like storyline and character dont get in the way of the stunts parts, which are the reason we are there. "
The main problem I had with Uncharted is everything is too easy for our protagonists...and most of the cast is wasted. 
"Winning buddy-movie chemistry between ""Uncharted"" stars Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg helps overcome the film's weaknesses."
"""Uncharted"" isn't a terrible movie  it's enjoyable enough with a few sprawling action sequences  but the wannabe ""National Treasure"" is a generic action movie that never captures the full excitement of playing through the franchise. "
"This film was good clean fun with a little bit of history and sightseeing added to the mix. Holland and Wahlberg have good chemistry--not exactly buddies, but close to mentor and student. The crosses are both gold and double. Buckle up in 4DX if you can."
"Thus, the critical process is simplified because the film sucks both as an adaptation and on its own merits (or lack thereof)."
"Uncharted drops toward the wrong end of the chart every time Holland and Wahlberg engage in juvenile bickering, which alas is all too often."
So unfailingly mediocre that I suspect even fans of the game will come away disappointed.
"This an entertaining experience from start to finish with excellent chemistry between the cast, a number of surprises, and a delightful connection to its inspiration..."
"Rather than find a way to surprise the audience, this is more of a film going through the motions and hoping the strength of the leads is enough to help it get by."
"Yes, trust is its own treasure -- and their gold-digging partnership promises a sequel. "
"Makes me wonder why someone didnt find the gold before, since it's rooted in available history, and the two white men break into ancient buildings in broad daylight with no blowback. Wahlberg says ""kid"" more than a goat shepherd in the herd's nursery."
"I's mostly in good (if not particularly clever) fun, entertaining enough, but with the nutritional value of a bag of Twizzlers."
"Thanks to some nice chemistry between its stars and smart casting of its two more intriguing female roles, it is much better than the script from Rafe Lee Junkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway they are handed."
"It’s by the numbers, and its sense of self importance renders it all kind of silly."
"Presenting us with very human protagonists and developing a potentially boring narrative with energy, “BlackBerry” works as a docu-drama. Surely those who were alive at this time and had a BlackBerry will feel some nostalgia. Full review in Spanish."
"Despite playing the story for more laughs than are probably necessary, the lead performances of BlackBerry are very watchable, and the story of the brand’s rise and demise is certainly one worth watching."
"This entertaining film features standout work from Baruchel, especially when he begins to crack with the realization that Apple is getting ready to kill his company with their upcoming iPhone, a product with the highest consumer interest in history."
BlackBerry is an impressive feat that marks Johnson’s leap from indie darling/TV Director to someone to genuinely watch out for.
"Investing heartily in its story's personalities, and eschewing myth-making reverence or preciousness, BlackBerry's makers entertainingly frame their film as a workplace dramedy about industry gate-crashers rudely ejected from a party of their own staging."
"Pacy, well-acted, and brilliantly written, this boardroom farce pushes all right the buttons."
"Rise-and-fall stories so often gloat after the bursting of the bubble, but this one is all condolences."
"[BlackBerry] perfectly captures the nerds-versus-the-system volatility of the tech bubble: Baruchel and Johnson stammer and gulp, while Howerton commands the film like a fascist warrior who uses fools to floss his teeth."
Johnson is also ruthless in his depiction of the business reality behind the glossy surface waffle of the tech dream. 
"Yet despite the guffaws, the film (directed by Matt Johnson) is deeper than a mere morality play about villainous money men. "
"It’s a film, ultimately, about failure. And immediately that makes it a far more intriguing proposition than all the boardroom backslapping of a movie such as Air."
"Blackberry gets lost in the minutiae of its own story halfway through, but is otherwise an entertaining cautionary tale.​"
"Bolstered by sterling work from Baruchel and a ferociously good Howerton as the unscrupulous Balsillie, BlackBerry is a cautionary tale of tech-world hubris told with dark humour and a satirical edge."
"Business-orientated stories don’t always make great entertainment, but BlackBerry works through its eccentric mix of characters, droll screenplay and the inherent drama of its vertiginous rise-and-fall storyline."
This is a watchable enough film...
A device that went the way of the dodo gets a lively epitaph you won’t need your hand held to enjoy.
It's all down to the performances that sets 'BlackBerry' apart from the herd of other corpo-dramas of late.
All three leads are superb and Johnson’s sharp script and fly-on-the-wall shooting style enables him to walk a fine between venerating and eviscerating his subjects.
"A corporate comedy of errors — but the film really shines thanks to Howerton, whose towering, shark-like performance makes him a villain for the ages."
"The characters are thinly sketched stereotypes (with the exception of Howerton, who it is hard not to like in any role). This is the kind of movie you would watch on a plane without complaint, then utterly forget."
"It's an intriguing take on the spectacular rise and demise of the cell phone that everyone had to have, until they didn't, but aspects of the movie's style and tone are distracting and over-drawn, detracting from its impact overall"
"Even more than The Social Network, where Aaron Sorkin’s script treats Mark Zuckerberg and co like flawed deities, this blackly comic corporate drama finds something intrinsically ridiculous about these egotistical men. "
BlackBerry is one of the BEST films of the year and a fully realized Canadian heritage moment.
"After the product romance comes the product tragedy. While Barbie is boosting Mattel’s sales figures, and Air made everybody feel warm and fuzzy about Nike’s best-selling sports shoe, for the BlackBerry it’s all too late"
"Even when Blackberry centres on the cautionary tale of the company’s demise, it also tells a refreshing and entertaining part of geek and tech history."
Blackberry is a classic rags-to-riches-to-rags story; a feel-good tale that transforms into a meditation on arrogance and neglect.
"BlackBerry is a timely and excellent reminder that, that as far as that piece of technology you’re reading this review on, there’s always something better just around the corner."
BlackBerry is a well written drama with amazing charactersiation and tension. I would not be surprised at all if this wasn’t a sleeper surprise come Oscar time because this is one of the best written and acted films I have seen so far this year.
If you are fascinated by fiscal tales of woe such as those spun by The Big Short then this is the movie for you.
"BlackBerry takes viewers on a roller coaster ride in telling this 'based on a true story' about the rise and fall of BlackBerry, the first popular smartphone. Glenn Howerton gives a standout performance as a greedy corporate villain with a nasty temper."
… a hilarious and decidedly more fictionalised take on the tech biopic sub-genre that still says a lot about the sector and how desperation is the father of invention.
Director Matt Johnson’s nutty slice of tech history is a crack-up at the start. But nobody is laughing when the BlackBerry’s nuts and bolts come undone.
"All the pressures and compromises of corporate life are on show, magnified by the speed at which the tech industry moves. "
"A bleakly comic requiem for an almost forgotten one-time technological breakthrough, BlackBerry is heck of a ride."
Excellent. More inventive and with more invective than anticipated.
"Snappy editing, sharp dialog, and a judicious rock soundtrack create an exciting portrait of an insanely successful high-tech startup – until, of course, fortunes turn."
"BlackBerry is a compelling blend of technology history, human relationships, and the ever-looming fear of becoming irrelevant."
Matt Johnson takes a quintessential biopic formula and makes his audience understand that good ideas can falter under the weight of men who can’t see the sky beyond the clouds.
"Matt Johnson’s heartfelt, humorous biopic manifests as both a new Canadian classic and a vibrant entry into the tech-movie canon."
"You already know what happens to Blackberry, but seeing how it all happens is part of the fun. "
"The MVP: Glenn Howerton as BlackBerry’s unscrupulous co-CEO, Jim Balsillie, who never met an underling he didn’t want to snap in half."
"BlackBerry is a refreshing, thought-provoking entry into the origin story film genre with its focus on the rise and fall of the first smartphone, the Blackberry."
...the balance of goofy and deadpan suits the pacing once the phone launches on the market.
[It] turns what would be a boring story about corporate strategy into high stakes drama.
"BlackBerry’s smart writing, zippy pace and thoroughly Canadian approach gives it a great deal of charm."
A gripping biographical tech-thriller with refreshingly witty passages and character-driven fortitude as its most entertaining values.
A surprisingly entertaining film about the ups and downs of a unique business venture.
"BlackBerry stands out by not being a nostalgic recounting of A Thing We Love From A Simpler Time, but a cautionary tale of how the same cycles of greed and corruption continue to play out over and over."
The rise and fall of the smartphone-turned-status symbol is chronicled in the funniest film of the year by writer-director Matt Johnson.
Johnson keeps things distinctly character-focused and never loses sight of the humanity at his story’s core. And all while being effortlessly funny in a subdued sharply witty way.
"For a while, 2023 had a new top film."
BlackBerry is a funny character-driven exploration of the rise and fall of a company and its two very different CEOs brought to life through powerful performances from Glenn Howerton and Jay Baruchel.
"BlackBerry is at its best when it has room to breathe and space to get loud. It’s theatrical in the best sense of the word, and a finely shot and composed comedy of misfits and mistakes."
"BlackBerry is as witty and sharp as it is entertaining, with its two leads, Baruchel and Howerton, absolutely nailing their characters and mining each for every bit of comedy and, indeed, drama."
"BlackBerry made me want to run through a wall and scream about the beauty of movies for adults until I was hoarse. This really is one of the year’s best movies.

"
An excellent exploration of an innovative but doomed product. 
"Howerton plays Balsillie like an actual shark – perpetually on the hunt, dead-eyed and dispassionate."
"""BlackBerry"" is a comic drama, and in true Canadian style, it ­features plenty of irony and satire. The movie isn’t actually about smartphones or the building of a company—it just uses a real company as the setting for the rise and fall of fallible men."
Glenn Howerton has a perfect way of twitching his eyes and tensing his mouth and cocking his head to convey both intense frustration and unearned confidence. It’s Oscar-worthy work.
"The mixture of creativity, and humor with cut-throat business is an intriguing tale."
...a fairly typical biopic that admittedly does remain a cut above its similarly-themed brethren...
"A wildly entertaining account of, as one character describes it, “The smart phone everyone had before they had an iPhone.”"
The sense of impending doom is palpable throughout this excellent dramedy about the rise and fall of the iconic mobile phone.
"An interesting character study of the two wildly different BlackBerry CEO's for whom the small, black, plastic phone functioned as Icarus's wings and flew them both too close to the sun. And plastic, like wax, melts. An engaging, cautionary tale. "
"Enjoyably seething, dorky and wryly comic."
"This is one of those whip-smart, character- and story-driven gems that grabs you from the start and never lets go."
"The drama doesn't justify [the style], but once you get past that, the script is really quite good. "
Baruchel is brilliant here as Lazaridis in what is easily one of his best performances.
BlackBerry is all the more riveting because of how complex its characters are. So much so that you end up both loving and hating each of the characters in equal measure.
"With doc-style filmmaking actor-director Matt Johnson maintains a witty tone that's thoroughly engaging, even as the movie stretches into a somewhat over-extended conclusion."
"BlackBerry is a funny, insightful dramedy about the smartphone that started it all. "
"With a robust and compelling story in hand,  BlackBerry begins by returning us to the Pleistocene days of the 1990s..."
" Interestingly ambivalent and scabrously funny, it’s an inverted 'Social Network' for also-rans."
"Like the device at its center, this film is smart, nimble and pretty much of a kick."
Glenn Howerton's comedic fingerprints are all over this film in the best way possible; anyone acting alongside him is automatically elevated to his level.
"A period piece about the founding of a transformational and dramatically tragic tech company with an inimitable, blackly comic performance at it center."
"Howerton brings something to BlackBerry, the scrappy Canadian indie about a scrappy Canadian company that changed the world, that goes above and beyond his usual lovable sociopath act. It’s not range. It’s rage. "
What emerges from the electronic noise and fussy aesthetic of “BlackBerry” is a compelling portrait of a company that flew too close to the sun. 
BlackBerry is one of the biggest surprises of 2023. A razor-sharp cautionary tale about the phone that was ahead of Apple in the mobile device game.
"Although Blackberry could have gone deeper with certain characters and themes, it succeeds in remaining intriguing throughout, and exuding a genuine sense of regret by its end."
"Entertains, lacks staying power."
"If the end result is being even less interested in seeing corporations—and the shady men who run them—reap enormous profits off our endless desire for the Next Big Thing, well, maybe that’s the uplifting story we need after all."
"Howerton gets the role of a life time, as this Juilliard trained actor completely disappears into the hockey loving, Gordon Gekko wannabe dispelling the stereotype of the nice Canadian. It's a tour-de-force performance."
"The film solidly follows the formula of a biopic and yet never falls into its generic beats. Thanks in large part to a career-defying turn from Glenn Howerton, who nails every single confrontation like a champ. "
Along with Air I think we got two very well made films about business that are actually interesting and worth watching that do feel more than just commercials for capitalism.
"Matt Johnson’s taut, entertaining, alarming film, precise, resonant script ... a colossal story, a Greek myth about rage, greed, naivete, and exploitation that thuds, landing hard on the earth from a great height. Johnson’s direction is flawless. 
"
"BlackBerry is not a film that takes a radical departure from the form, but its mixture of comedy and workplace drama — taking cues from the likes of The Big Short and The Office — makes it delectable viewing."
The most important aspect of BlackBerry is the fact that this is not a hero’s journey for anyone involved; this is a story about what it means to be smart in some ways and dumb in others.
"Johnson applies a screwball procedural framework to a true story of tech-world boom and bust, building his movie on a clash of values and personalities."
"“BlackBerry” plays like a prototype still waiting to be realized, a sketch that’s still undeveloped."
An extreme look at extreme characters with necessary personality clashes and some incredible performances.
"Its point is less to document an actual product development process, and more to offer a parable of nerds colliding headfirst with cutthroat capitalism."
"BlackBerry isn’t the best workplace drama of the season, but it is funny and engaging."
"Matt Johnson capably assembles a cool, chaotic R&D docudrama looking back at the Blackberry with tech savvy humor, ripe for the picking."
BlackBerry is incredibly entertaining.
"BlackBerry is a fast, funny and often thrilling ride, one that ends up worthy of both time spent and time capsule."
"More than tech geeks can revel in the nostalgia of this captivating comedy, which eschews mockery in favor of a crowd-pleasing balance of quirks and heart."
"BlackBerry is a clever and intentional tale of everything that could have and did go awry with the world's first smartphone. Full of fallible and selfish characters, it serves as an antidote to overly saccharine success stories. "
"The movie is an intense laugh riot, though laden with fraught drama as things fall apart."
"Lawrence's extremely ugly film loses itself in the back half when it stops focusing on how community supports Katniss and simply becomes another arena film. The adaptation couldn't escape Collins' bad source material, but why did it have to be ~2.5 hrs?"
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 may not be remembered for its quality as a film, or even its promotion of the female-centric narrative, but the highly-engaging conclusion delivers on the promise of Suzanne Collins’ novels."
Ultimately 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2' provides a satisfying end to the story rather than an inspiring one.
"What comes as a shock is how the Hollywood adaptation has maintained many of the most controversial and un-commercial elements of the story, delivering a narrative with themes of terrorism, violence as entertainment, entertainment as propaganda."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Parts 1 and 2 make for an epic conclusion to the franchise but the second film is stronger than the first.
"Unlike its predecessor, it has a good pace and knows how to balance political content and action. Those who read the books will get by with a good adaptation, although perhaps a little cold compared to the original story [Full review in Spanish]"
"Mockingjay Part 2 brings a solid conclusion to a riveting series, with a wonderfully suspenseful buildup and a solid end that is sure to satisfy."
Do a shot every time Katniss is knocked out and fights to regain consciousness and my guess is you'll be just a shell-shocked as she is by the end of the movie.
"Even when the set designs show potential as battlegrounds of claustrophobic, mazy terrors, they're spoiled by traditional zombie hordes or video game-like deathtraps."
It may be that everyone involved has merely grown a little bored with a limited storyline whose more intriguing elements have inevitably been eroded.
"Any film franchise adapted from the books will never entirely satisfy everyone. But with The Hunger Games, the franchise comes to a satisfactory and epic end."
A tedious and dour experience that fails to bring its themes together in a satisfying manner.
"Feels like the fragment it is, but provides a satisfactory end to the larger saga."
"If you have been faithful to the franchise, you will surely love this movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
What we see in 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2' is the absence of emotion witnessed in the first installments of this popular franchise. [Full review in Spanish]
The series finally concludes with the poorly named The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 2.
"[M]ay not be the best film of the franchise, and it may seem a little lackluster as an ending for a franchise as epic as this, but it serves the franchise, the books, and Katniss Everdeen well. This is the perfect ending for this legacy."
"The Hunger Games series is one of those rare critically beloved, publicly championed occurrences that deserves admiration for its ability to entertain in a sophisticated, meaningful, intelligent way."
"The filmmakers saved the best for last, pulling out all the stops and delivering a film that is both heart-stopping and heartbreaking."
Sadly this final chapter is best served only to completionists.
"There's little light to perforate the the dark here, but its relentless gritted teeth has always been The Hunger Games' greatest strength. It's also taken great care to make its characters' stakes and motivations clear throughout."
"Mockingjay -- Part 2 serves as a decent film, but isn't necessarily the grand finale that fans are hoping for. It hits some right notes and it is an entertaining watch, but the intensity is lacking in a franchise that is built on intensity."
"Whether you find the movie entertaining or not is a question of taste, but I predict wide audiences will find Katniss' final fight too irksome to enjoy."
"Jennifer Lawrence is the reason the series, and ""Mockingjay Part 2"" ultimately works, building to a crowd-pleasing conclusion that wraps everything up quite nicely."
"Now, with the conclusive The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, ardent and casual fans of this imaginative and charged film franchise will get a chance to soak in the cinematic experience that has carried them through this durable trilogy."
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a movie less than the sum of its parts, mainly because most of its parts were used to make the previous movie."
"It still doesn't surpass Catching Fire as the high point of the franchise, but it is a noble effort."
"Just this once, we'll agree to forgive the fact that we had to buy four movie tickets to see three films."
Necessarily dark and disturbing.
"An angry, uncomfortable Hunger Games is not the thing of box office records. So here we are. At the end, unsatisfied, but victorious."
It is the mark of a great franchise that one starts to miss the hero or heroine even before they have gone.
Katniss looked tired and emotional throughout most of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 2 and the tiredness was definitely contagious!
"Mockingjay is true to the book: in the end, we're all just tired, resigned and want the bad stuff to stop."
"This movie makes some fascinating stylistic choices, that force you to confront the personal consequences of violence and violation."
Part 2 staggers under the weight of the source material's ambition.
"Somewhere, a talented fan-editor will undertake the task of combining the most important bits of both films into one three-hour epic that can stand alone as the grandstanding conclusion this franchise deserved"
Director Lawrence ... gives the other characters a greater sense of development with the result that the movie doesn't come across as a Jennifer Lawrence Glorification Vehicle.
"Filled with genuine thrills, gripping tension and rallying hero moments galore, the trilogy comes to a close in epic fashion, befitting its bad-ass heroine."
"How disappointing it is to report that this final instalment is by far and away the worst film in the franchise. Not only is it gloomy, dull and virtually surprise-free; it's also unforgivably cheap-looking."
"There is no momentum in Mockingjay Part 2, as the pacing is terrible."
"In the case of Francis Lawrence's one-two punch with Mockingjay (the concluding text of The Hunger Games series), Part 2 seeks to perfectly execute the game plan."
"Now that we have this movie, you could skip Mockingjay 1 entirely and not miss anything but inessential pouting."
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (there, that's the last time I have to type that mouthful) has not dethroned its predecessors to take the spot of best movie in the franchise. But it is a solid action film full of memorable performances."
"In lesser hands, Katniss's willingness to suffer for the whole world may seem like classic teen narcissism... But Lawrence possesses an astonishing ability to convey profound emotional seriousness without ever seeming to do anything."
"Mockingjay Part 2 is a satisfying conclusion overall, with the franchise as a whole being so satisfying within the dismal dystopian YA genre that it only feels disappointing considering what has come before."
"Mockingjay Part 2's gloomy, monotone approach makes this feel like an exhausting obligation to sit through."
"Compared to other Young Adult adaptations the Hunger Games films are undeniably the most mature and well-acted, digging deep into the emotional and political core of the books."
"The series-capper boasts its share of eye-popping action-movie spectacle, but like Collins' novels, it forces viewers to deal with grim losses while nailing the book's shocking climax."
"I like that both the book and the movie ditched the action-y bombast and took Katniss' story to a quieter, more emotionally resonant place. It felt earned, given The Hunger Games has always been more about Katniss' character evolution."
"Still a strong effort, and I respect the heck out of the filmmakers' collective efforts to maintain thematic fidelity to the overarching ideas Collins' novels deftly end up exploring."
"iI's an enjoyable enough watch and if you've been with the series from the beginning you should go and see it to finish things off. But speaking as a fan of The Hunger Games, I don't see myself choosing to sit through it again any time soon."
"A movie of limited intrinsic merit, and about which it's difficult to make any positive claim for its quality stronger than that it's definitely better than Mockingjay Part 1."
When it gets to its final stretch -- the one that nothing except books or Wikipedia or other movies can prepare you for -- Mockingjay Part 2 is well-prepared for what might strike non-fans (or even some actual fans) as anticlimax.
It takes an actress of the calibre of Jennifer Lawrence to successfully convey The Hunger Games protagonist's existential conundrum.
Holy heck is it good.
"For the past three falls, a new 'Hunger Games' movie has come around to remind us that so many of its elements - blockbuster franchise, YA novel adaptation, multiple films from one book - aren't inherently evil."
Part 2 adds some much-needed adventure back into the mix.
A series that just a few years ago seemed to bubble with personality and intrigue and depth is closed out here as coldly as possible.
None of the film-makers in the series has worked out how to marry its smaller concerns about love and family with its larger themes of propaganda and dying for a cause.
"Mockingjay Part 2 is one great example of the source material being respected, partially because with fans like this saga has, such allegiance is expected."
The pace picks up as Katniss traverses a city laced with booby traps - an oil flood and a tunnel full of mutants provide the film's best action scenes.
"Although the pace picks up, there's no sense of grandness to what is meant to be a huge finale and, actually, some may even feel underwhelmed by how the plot plays out."
A fittingly serviceable end to a series that always had more potential than impact.
"[The] rare blockbuster that finds a compelling middle ground between thoughtfulness and big, splashy spectacle."
Kudos to Lawrence for helping bring a satisfactory conclusion
A satisfying conclusion to a brilliant series of films that show us the dangers of the oligarchy.
"In this final film, fans will get a satisfying resolution. It's an emotional and dark journey illuminated by an otherworldly performance from Jennifer Lawrence."
I remember struggling with Suzanne Collins' final book. It didn't have the same sense of urgency and excitement. My thoughts on this movie are essentially the same.
"I understand that YA books succeed by transposing real teen concerns into life-and-death fantasy situations, but any connection to the characters that existed by the end of 2013's Catching Fire has been stripped away by these plodding Mockingjay movies."
"It's frustrating to watch the Jennifer Lawrence be marched from plot point to plot point, just getting things over with."
"Part 2 feels like it has a sense of direction that was lost after the first movie, and it's enjoyably more action-heavy."
the last hour of Hunger Games 3.2 is good enough that deeper readings of this text would actually hold water in a way that previous attempts to politicize it have failed.
"Relentlessly bleak from the first frame, this final outing pulls no punches as white knuckle action sequences see the casualty rate rise alongside the tension."
"While there's lots to recommend the movie, the silly premise is the only thing I could focus on for the entire 2 hours and 17 minutes -- which is inexcusably long for a movie that is actually just half of a movie."
"In this overegged yet satisfying conclusion to the adaptation of Suzanne Collins's post-apocalyptic trilogy The Hunger Games, the body count is high, the tone at its darkest and most despairing, and nothing is sacred."
"It reminds us that every ""happy"" ending can also be a tragedy. [Full review in Spanish]"
"This 137 minute conclusion results heavy and drags considerably due to its lack of what it promised: Action, emotion, unrestrained rage. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Well, the Hunger Games finally grew up at the end, after all that silliness about the earth-shattering importance of fashion statements. We finally got one convincing romance, to go with a real battle and real politics."
"action and theme don't always cohere, and what's good in the film too often has to be dug out from under a lot of underwhelming excess"
"Affirms Katniss Everdeen's status as the most significant of the reluctant teen heroes who have battled adult tyranny in the fantasy movie series of the past few decades (and no, I'm not forgetting Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter)."
"Part 2 is supposed to be the emotional crescendo to an epic love triangle, but due a complete lack of chemistry between Lawrence and her callow male co-stars, it's all hollow, and the gold-embossed Super Happy Ending feels fraudulent. D.B."
"So much better than last year's plodding, aimless Part 1."
"Mockingjay Part 2 is a worthy conclusion to Katniss' saga with great, epic moments. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"If anything is certain beyond the wavering quality of this series, it's that it has always remained focused on the immense strength of its very dedicated heroine."
It's a fitting finale to a much-loved franchise.
It's the second best film in the series.
"It could have been a better, riskier, more interesting movie. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"The freshness of the concept is now gone, and the slick finale doesn't stand on its own."
I think that Mockingjay - Part 2 is not a bad movie. It's just more of the same. [Full review in Spanish]
"The conclusion to the Hunger Games franchise ends up being a completely anticlimatic, boring, and worthy of a soap opera finale. [Full review in Spanish]"
A great ending for one of the most enjoyable franchises in recent time. [Full review in Spanish]
A grand finale for the series in which the characters deal with the spiritual question: What is the truth?
"A fitting ending to a strong series, this final chapter offers the action that audiences would hope for and the emotional climax that fans deserve."
"In the last chapter of this overhyped saga, the plot drags too much and rushes to solve all the loose ends. [Full review in Spanish]"
Fans of the series will see it come to a satisfying end. [Full review in Spanish]
It's pretty obvious this last book could've been reduced to a single film. [Full review in Spanish]
This is marginally better than the first Mockingjay installment simply as there isn't all the endless stage-setting and self-important yakking.
"As wobbly as Mockingjay - Part 2 is, it's powerful because its characters and conflicts have become so familiar in the culture, and because it completes a long and painful journey."
"Mockingjay is a lengthy demonstration packed with more grief and soul searching than fun, to some readers' dismay... Yet it's hard not to admire the chutzpah of a heroic epic that debunks everything about heroes and epics."
"I prefer the second movie, but The Hunger Games is something to see as a whole. [Full Review in Spanish]"
... one of the most fun and honest animated features of our times as well as enjoyable and original. [Full review in Spanish]
"If we had a kids movie that inspired that kind of creativity every year, it'd be a slightly happier world."
"At least preferable to another recent summer hit, the torturous Despicable Me 3."
"If your kids are familiar with the books by Dav Pilkey, they will probably get a kick out of the age-appropriate potty humor and fart jokes in the movie. I have to confess that I really enjoyed the antics of George and Harold."
"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie just barely misses the mark, but the way it misses it is very interesting."
"For a modern-day superhero movie, Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie is fun, energetic, and displays a respect for the creative mind that few films in any genre do."
"... the look of the film and how it develops should appeal to most people who love fun, imaginative animated films."
This was a great kids movie that can totally work as a franchise and actually makes even this adult want to delve into the books.
"Based on the book series by Dav Pilkey, directed by David Soren (the man behind Turbo), and written by Nicholas Stoller, from script to animation the result is a seamless adaptation of non-stop zaniness, laughter and heart."
This dynamic scene exchange is supported by a surprising handling of different animation techniques. [Full review in Spanish]
The heart and unrelenting likability of this film should charm even the most hardened viewer.
I was really charmed by this film.
"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie makes its intentions clear from the very beginning. This movie is unapologetically ridiculous, yet never feels shallow or condescending."
"Even if you haven't got kids, give it a sneaky viewing for some fun and to marvel at Uranus."
"Mindless, poop-joke filled fun that celebrates the importance of a loyal friendship."
The absent-minded plot and paper-thin themes do often make the film feel more like several episodes of a cartoon show stuck together rather than a feature film ...
"Registering as a toilet-training session in hilarity for third graders, yet demonstrating a subversive streak of satirical overtones for the mature masses Captain Underpants will be sure to plant a permanent smirk on the faces of countless viewers"
"While the plot of Captain Underpants is a silly romp based on toilets and childhood rebellion, there is so much going on underneath the surface that it elevates the film from playful fun to very good."
Captain Underpants doesn't try to hide the fact that it's aiming for a very young audience that are amused by farts but is able to slip enough wit in there that parents won't want to rip out their hair.
"Hilariously fast-paced summer comedy that is faithful to its equally crazy source material, this is one of the most clever and imaginative animated films released this year."
"Many of the gags early on are aimed at older cinemagoers, but once the potty humour starts in earnest younger patrons will soon catch up on the giggle count."
The movie is visually fun. It has a very simple animation style which actually works in its favor.
"Captain Underpants would be easy to overlook as another kids-only waste of money. That's not the case. The film subverts this every step of the way and constantly turns in new, unexpected directions."
"As superhero films shift more in the direction of mature themes (even the PG-13 offerings are starting to push the envelope), a specifically child-friendly hopeful franchise starter such as Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie is an appreciated gift"
Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie entertains... and more. [Full review in Spanish]
This tested my boundaries.
"My interest waned during the chaotic final act when the narrative is put aside and we're treated to a ho-hum, over-the-top action fest."
"A good option for kids, if it's okay for your children to come into contact with a little bit of eschatological humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Without a doubt it's one of the best children's comedies I've seen all year and, quite possibly, one that accompanying parents will enjoy even more than their offspring."
Seldom has the link between Uranus jokes and the survival of mankind been drawn so convincingly.
"Flatulent, but not fatuous fun."
David Soren's computer-animated adaptation of Dav Pilkey's hit series of children's books avoids the pitfalls with enough success to amuse all ages.
"A sweet, silly and fun animated comedy, Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie is adapted from the lovably lowbrow children's books of author-illustrator Dav Pilkey."
"A film proud of its basic humor and its crude jokes ... and precisely because of that, it works so well. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Takes being a child quite seriously, and makes no effort to speak above the heads of the 11-year-olds in the audience."
a whole lot of escapist enjoyment.
"An original, funny and crazy story that teaches us the true value of friendship and teamwork. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Cinematographically impeccable, a children's film that the adults will enjoy as well. [Full review in Spanish]"
The film has an atmosphere of innocence and nostalgia that invites us to rediscover the genuine pleasures of the excitement and amusement that recess provoked in us. [Full review in Spanish]
"Surprisingly, and unlike a pair of the titular heroes y-fronts, Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie never really rubs you up the wrong way."
Relies too heavily on toilet humor and lacks positive morals or teachings. [Full review in Spanish]
"'Captain Underpants' is clever, laugh-out-loud fun."
"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie may be silly, stupid and ridiculous, but it's incredibly creative with its humour, animation, characters and story that its silliness makes it all part of its charm."
"In some respects it's a bit too pleased with itself, but it breezes by fast enough to make those summer holiday trips to the movies a little more bearable."
"Silly and aimed squarely at the younger crowd, Captain Underpants has enough spirit to be entertaining. Just don't expect it to work all the time."
"This movie plays like Ferris Bueller in fourth class and even includes Yello's Oh Yeah by way of a tribute. Chicka, chicka!"
"The film highlights the value of creativity, friendship and more than anything, has a good sense of humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Funny, absurd and smart-stupid enough to keep everyone happy."
"A snappy animated comedy with a lovely, gooey, sentimental heart."
"If the story is strictly one-ply thin, the pre-tween perspective is upheld with infectious exuberance."
"The spasmodic, overheated animation alone will probably be catnip to younger audiences but Captain Underpants... also displays some very subversive comedy writing that exudes a level of mischief that at times would make even Pixar blush."
"The ensuing slapstick and general craziness are silly, funny and delivered at sugar-rush speed."
Young kids will have a giggle and even grown-ups might crack a smile. A very pleasant surprise.
It's not a classic DreamWorks film but there's enough here to keep little ones laughing and parents from nodding off.
"In the best way, it's a gas."
"It's a dizzily silly collection of sly cultural references. It's visually inventive, narratively agile. And yes, it has fart gags."
"If ever we needed an antidote to the mythologising pomposity of superhero movies, it's now. Enter Captain Underpants, a lovable and winningly irreverent animation inspired by the children's novels of Dav Pilkey."
"Sweet, subversive, and absolutely hilarious, at once a snarky superhero sendup and an unironically joyful celebration of friendship and imagination."
There's nothing epic about this stinker of a film.
"See it, laugh at it, love it. And take your best friend -- they'll appreciate it."
A hugely likeable animated film about two cornerstones of childhood: wild imaginations and bottom jokes.
"If you grew up being told that toilet humour isn't funny, try this."
Captain Underpants is wondrously inane and bizarre entertainment.
It's a thoroughly entertaining and likable film: two qualities that look easy but are anything but. Captain Underpants deserves a franchise.
"Just when your brain's starting to ache, the film chucks in another subversive crack about America's failing school system, or a genuinely hilarious sock-puppet-animated flashback."
"Sharp, zippy, impressively animated and surprisingly funny, the movie is another welcome bit of levity at the movies and a reminder to Hollywood that kid's films deserve more craft to them."
A great pastime that offers a kind of fun similar to the cartoons that we used to watch in the mornings at the time that the animated cinema of Hollywood seemed forgotten. [Full review in Spanish]
"While I can't foresee [Captain Underpants] spawning any additional cinematic chapters in George and Harold's heroic tale, if it sends viewers to the library and the bookstore to discover what happens next that's perfectly fine by me."
"The level of this film is more of an eschatological joke that is, of course, childish but lacks of the slightest grace, despite its naivety. The gags are shameful even for children. [Full review in Spanish]"
The film doesn't stop bringing together huge amounts of naive eschatological gags with brilliant and extemporaneous critical references about government neglecting education and the unjustly paid teachers. [Full review in Spanish]
An entertaining movie for children (that doesn't embarrass adults). [Full review in Spanish]
"It defends the therapeutic power of the most primitive laugh and that's ok, but it would've been better if, instead of devoting itmself to shooting so many fireworks, it would've been concerned to be funnier. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Captain Underpants bursts with anarchic energy, and I still laugh out loud when I remember the villain voiced by Nick Kroll revealing his full name as Professor P. P. Diahrreastein Poopypants."
"Juvenile humor abounds in Captain Underpants, but the movie is smart about the way it contextualizes this lowbrow comedy. There's an innocence about it all, a rarity in this genre, one with which adults will nostalgically connect."
"George Clooney once said ""[flatulence is] one of the funniest things in the history of mankind,"" a sentiment shared by children, men, and dogs everywhere. 'Captain Underpants' cheerfully brings the potty humor."
Giddy satire gives way to lazy bombast in this animated adaptation of Dav Pilkey's children's book series.
"Captain Underpants' plethora of animation styles (including a wonderful sock puppet sequence) separates the film into imaginative sublayers, keeping it from feeling like the one-joke wonder that it often edges towards."
"When the fan sprays potty jokes all over the wall, everyone likely will laugh at something. In our family. the 3-year-old giggled whenever she heard the surname of the villainous Prof. Poopypants (and wait'll you get a load of his full name)!"
"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie perfectly captures the goofy spirit of its source material. Plus, it has a theme song performed by Weird Al, so how can it go wrong?"
"In the end, it's impossible to ignore the fact that this feature is devoid of even the simplest positive morals or takeaways. And it's not quite funny or wry enough to forgive its weaknesses."
It's a bird! it's a plane! It's a kids' movie that won't make grownups want to manually remove their own toenails!
"This is the kind of movie that includes fart jokes, but also includes its own built-in critique and aesthetic appreciation of fart jokes."
"Yes, the humor of Captain Underpants is juvenile, but in this case that's a compliment. This is a movie for the inner 8-year-old in all of us."
"The friendship of George and Harold is celebrated, and the cheery vocal work of Hart and Middleditch gives the picture its sprightly spirit."
"The film also inventively incorporates CG animation, live-action sock puppets and a flipbook to bring to life the pages of Pilkey's sentimental ode to boyhood."
"The frantic action is frequently funny, with giant toilet monsters attempting to establish a new excremental world order"
"While crude humor rules the day in this animated adventure, there's also a good-natured playfulness that provides some solid laughs above the belt."
"For something called Captain Underpants, there's more to it than meets the eye."
"Captain Underpants is a potty humor masterpiece. It is meant for young children, but the adults will also be chuckling."
"I don't think Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie should be as good as it is -- which is to say, light and breezy and solid early-summertime fun -- solely because its name is Captain Underpants."
"Clever, sweet, smart and sassy, the animated Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie is stuffed with many weird and funny elements."
"While the movie is solidly and unapologetically pitched towards kids, it has a subversive streak that is as genuine and sharp as anything whipped up by Roald Dahl."
"Thanks to a top-notch screenplay by Nicholas Stoller, Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie manages to be both a faithful adaptation of Dav Pilkey's source material and a fun-filled animated adventure suitable for all ages."
There's a blissful silliness to all this that works on adults and kids alike.
I haven't been this surprisingly delighted with an animated feature I'd been skeptical about since Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.
"The important thing is that while the production never reaches for intellectual grandeur, it is on a very basic level one of the funniest movies of the year."
"It's an odd mix, to be sure, but for celebrating a child's creative urge, the transformative power of art and the pleasure of undressing power with wit, Captain Underpants is a sweet brief encounter."
"The underlying messages here are all uplifting. Boring school can be made fun. Making art is good. Creativity rules. So do true friendship and love. The occasional butt joke harms no one. And if it bothers an uptight adult, all the better."
"All of this is bound by the boys' fight against evil to keep fun alive. ""Captain Underpants"" does just that. Have fun!"
"In adapting Dav Pilkey's children's books for the big screen, Captain Underpants director David Soren (Turbo) and screenwriter Nicholas Stoller (Neighbors) get remarkably steady comic rewards out of whoopee cushions and toilets."
"Seems like a miracle that something like this could be pulled off, fully amplifying and improving upon everything each solo MCU movie accomplished before it, while also standing on its own with the team dynamics."
"You wouldn’t accuse 'The Avengers' of being good drama, but the sprawling, splashy spectacle and its much-much-much-larger-than-life heroes makes for a genuine comic book epic for the big screen."
"After four years’ worth of building piece by piece against mounting expectations, Marvel and Whedon have managed to satisfy the majority of fan expectations, and in some ways, even exceeded them."
Everyone is invested in their character and not one single performer phones it in. 
"Go back a rewrite the definitions for ""unprecedented,"" ""groundbreaking,"" and those other buzz words."
"The Avengers, as a movie, can be best described as one of the most prominent examples of a crowd pleaser."
"The story works, the acting is superb, the humor is on key and the action sequences are breathtaking."
The 2010s will undeniably go down as the decade of superheroes...
"It is the textbook example of a comic book movie, the gold standard to strive for, and a validation of comic book storytelling as an art form."
"A mega-budget action extravaganza that succeeds on just about every level, and it's one you should certainly go and see as soon as possible."
A perfect example of an ensemble cast and great example of well shot spectacle that also manages to actually develop a lot of the titular heroes as well. Great stuff.
"The posing, evil grimacing to denote villainy, and arsenal of one-liners are at an all-time high."
The Avengers will undoubtedly please nearly all fanboys and most other moviegoers hoping for the quintessential popcorn flick experience.
"'The Avengers' is an amazing madness that guarantees entertainment, fun and awe with the most fantastic gathering of heroes that cinema has ever seen. [Full review in Spanish]"
'The Avengers' May Be the Best Comic Book Film Ever Made
"Clever, funny, emotional, and downright amazing; The Avengers is a spectacle which demands repeat viewings. Joss Whedon has delivered what is quite simply an epic comic book movie masterpiece."
"...not without its flaws, but Joss Whedon has put together an immensely enjoyable film, the best Marvel-based one to date, and one that is not in the least bit ashamed of its comic book roots."
"This star-studded, action packed film lives up to all the hype."
The Avengers is as close as you can get to a quintessential blockbuster experience. One of the rare MCU films where the action beats feel entirely like extensions of story and character.
"Overall, Marvel's Avengers Assemble is fun, funny and downright entertaining. Joss Whedon did good."
I think the problem is inherent in the format.
"It is no longer enough for one superhero to fight a single villain while dealing with his own personal problems, apocalypse must now enter into it."
The movie is not utterly worthless in every way. I'll grant that. But does that mean it's good? Or even adequate? No.
Tightly scripted and filled with enough moments of levity to balance the extended and spectacular battle sequences.
Gets everything right. So entertaining when our characters gather to fight Loki who is the best.
Marvel's The Avengers is the team-up movie that we've been waiting for and it's absolutely everything we wanted it to be.
"The film begins with a bang and builds from there, a thrill ride peppered with Whedon's trademark self-aware humor. It's fun to watch all these egos clash, especially Downey, who just owns the Tony Stark role."
"The Avengers will appeal to fans of comic books, fans of action and fans of characterization and dialogue. It's a pretty awesome assembly."
This all-star superhero extravaganza is fun entertainment at a grand scale.
"If you're in the market for one of the most wondrous and entertaining cinematic experience you could ever hope to have, book your tickets, buy your popcorn and prepare to be amazed."
"The Avengers is an engaging-enough film. But with that kind of treasure, talent and time, you'd expect more -- a lot more than this completely conventional action flick delivers."
It will forever stand as Exhibit A in the case for why the Marvel Cinematic Universe exists and why it continues to thrive.
"This is an incredible action movie. From special effects to fights to explosions, it hits every marker. But the movie is so much more. It's hysterically funny, charming and smart."
Avengers Assemble does exactly what it says on the tin: the Avengers assemble and proceed to smash things up...a lot!
"The Avengers shatters the last barrier separating the printed page and the celluloid image, fully wresting the superhero genre away from the medium that birthed it."
"Sounds kind of corny, you say? Oh, that's nothing. Massive corn-shucking in this film, corn piled everywhere, cornpone, corn fritters, corn syrup, corn as high as an elephant's eye, the Feast of Our Great God Corn!"
"This is what a comic book movie should be: thrilling, exciting and surprisingly, almost shockingly, human."
Achieves something more than just a competent wrangling of diverse comic book stories: it manages to keep Hollywood egos in check
Black Widow has so much potential! We hope they seize on it within the next 6 years! *a tumbleweed blows by*
"The final action scene, which runs for over half-an-hour, is awe-inspiring."
For an action movie there are a lot of genuinely funny lines. There were parts of this movie that had my laughing out loud.
Probably the best superhero/comics movie of all time. [Full review in Spanish]
It works on nearly every level and is a testament to a great director working with a great group of actors and a studio that knew when to get out of the way and let the creatives be creative.
"[The Avengers] is fast-paced, funny, thrilling and well-crafted."
"The comedic timing, coupled with his ability to maintain the authenticity of the characters, is worthy of praise. The Avengers delivers a popcorn feast that's the perfect summer kickoff."
Just the right combination of affection and silliness.
"By crafting a winning combination of wonderful characters, brilliant comedy, and spectacular set pieces, Whedon hasn't simply created the biggest superhero movie; he's created one of the best."
"What Whedon and Marvel have created here is not just extraordinary, but one of the most entertaining and satisfying comic book movies yet."
"Robert Downey Jr's billionaire playboy inventor Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, gets the film's self-aware, tongue-in-cheek tone spot on, delivering Whedon's wisecracks with sardonic charm."
[Marvel's The Avengers] is such a pure and unadulterated comic-book movie that it will bring you to tears.
A lot of fun.
"Downey's Stark/Iron Man steals the show because the actor is capable of making the tritest dialogue sound wonderfully witty, but the CGI effects are amazing and, despite its length, the film is very enjoyable."
"Infusing plenty of laconic wit into his role, Robert Downey Jr is impressive as ever."
"As Tony Stark, RDJ infuses that much needed spark and life into the movie with his superb one-liners."
"To get an idea of the overall mood, you have to imagine something starring Buster Keaton, Spencer Tracy, Sylvester Stallone and Marlon Brando, and directed by Michael Bay and Sidney Lumet on a bank of giant green screens."
The relentless action mixed with some potent 3D makes for some jaw dropping viewing.
"A big, splashy movie in which stuff blows up a lot, yet you go home talking about the actors."
Shrug however you might at a story that has to pack so many characters and tangents into 140 minutes; it will still be difficult for me to see beyond the joyous awesomeness.
It's little surprise this is largely a terrifically enjoyable experience -- one that'll please both fanboys and the public at large.
"This will be loved by genre fans, when all is said and done/ But at two hours forty, you may find it numbs your bum/ Seriously, more attention to character could have made it a lot more fun/ And now I have said all that, I believe my poem is done."
"Is Avengers Assemble the best comic book film ever? That's a tough call but it's certainly the most exciting, and a true epic moment in cinematic history."
"Joss Whedon knows exactly what comic-book geeks want to see. That's why ""Marvel's The Avengers"" is so immensely satisfying."
"If we must have these box-office behemoths, then at least the writer-director, Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is a lively controlling influence."
"Of course it's about one hundred times brighter than Transformers and Michael Bay's imbecilic spinoffs, and should keep multiplexes everywhere in its competent grip. But I didn't love it."
"The special effects are impressive but not especially imaginative, and the film is unduly protracted."
"For all who have hotly fan-ticipated this all-star collection of Marvel's superheroes, you have reason to be excited. You can officially geek out now."
The Avengers does have is a solid gold structure that doesn't buckle under the weight of its gargantuan expectations and overflowing cast.
"Smart, witty, funny, action-packed and surprisingly cathartic."
"The bigger and goofier it gets, the more fun it becomes."
A fun light-hearted summer blockbuster that is weighed down by a forgettable villain.
"If you're not already a fanboy, it'll turn you into one. It is honestly the most fun I have had at the movies in a long, long time."
"After two-and-a-half hours of world-threatening chaos and world-saving derring-do, you leave the theater satisfied, but without so much as a single memorable image (or idea) lingering in your mind."
"Joss Whedon empties everything at his reported $225 million disposal to assault the eyes, ears and intelligence with one of the stupidest comic book tales ever put to film."
"Whedon must balance the competing storylines and screen time of the actors. He does it nicely, injecting humour and a touch of drama into the action -- and all without so much as a Tesseract to his name. Some assembly required, and delivered."
One of the ten best films of 2012.
"But one of the most fascinating moments in the picture occurs when Captain America, referring to Thor, notes: ""There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that."" Ah, monotheism versus paganism. Can they exist side by side?"
"Whedon has delivered that rare action-packed, special-effects spectacle that is relentless in its eagerness to please and successful beyond its goal."
It's Summer's Mightiest Movie. Nuff said.
"When all is said and done, Avengers is all sound and Nick Fury, signifying nothing."
Was Marvel's ambitious dream for a shared cinematic universe truly worth it? In my opinion: Most definitely.
The Avengers is one of the best superheroes movies in a long time and is likely to become a classic of the genre. You would need to really hate comic book movies not to get a kick out of this.
The Star Wars of a new generation.
"""Marvel's The Avengers"" is a visual comic book and it doesn't aspire to be anything more than that. As a film version it succeeds-one is tempted to say-MIGHTILY."
It really is quite something that [Whedon] was able to take so many characters and put them into a movie where nobody gets left behind.
"It really is an astounding achievement - a film that juggles an unenviable number of elements; combining what we've seen before, slotting them together and then adding enough depth, action and humour to make this a remarkable standalone film."
"Marvel's ""The Avengers"" is the super-hero movie to end all super-hero movies. Why? Joss Whedon."
"Without Robert Downey Jr. delivering his witty quips in patented rat-a-tat-tat fashion, The Avengers would largely be a soulless shell of a movie that could be mistaken for a Michael Bay production."
"After years of buildup and prequels, ""The Avengers"" is merely average."
"The first great superhero team movie, and a film that captures the essence of what makes the Marvel Universe great."
"The filmmakers play a conservative game, not setting out to make a great movie but simply making sure not to screw it up an entire franchise."
Feels like actual Marvel Comics are being injected directly into your bloodstream. It's simply jaw-dropping.
"While it reflects a movie culture that has traded originality for scale - one wonders if there's a shred of originality anywhere in the film - The Avengers is grand, throwaway fun."
"It's as big, funny, shiny, explosive, expert, rip-roaringly entertaining an action movie as we've seen in a long time."
"Yeah, it's all that. A tent-pole cash cow for the studio, a dream come true for fans, and treat for action aficionados, 'The Avengers' comes at you as the first true ""summer movie spectacular"" of the 2012 season."
Wonderful blink and you'll miss them comic beats in the middle of the finale's mayhem. And what glorious mayhem!
... The movie isn't so much a work of storytelling as it is a marathon of wish-fulfillment moments for comic book enthusiasts -- punches peppered with punchlines.
The culmination of four distinct franchises is an exciting and entertaining product.
It's the humor that's The Avengers' strength.
"One hundred and forty-three minutes of head-pounding bombast, The Avengers is an exhausting experience."
"Whedon's clear fanboy glee is irresistibly contagious to the audience, whether the heroes and villains go at it with fisticuffs or sharp, witty dialogue."
A riveting war story that reveals the bonds that build between soldiers and interpreters
"In telling a specific story of wartime camaraderie, the film offers good fodder for discussions of grace, guilt, and the gospel."
It is a tight drama that looks at the war in Afghanistan in 2018 and its aftermath that works on multiple levels and is so finely written that it flows from beginning to end.
"In a film that is supposed to focus on the tragedy of Afghan civilians during and after the war, it is at least disconcerting that the point of view is that of Sergeant Kinley... [Full review in Spanish]"
I am really frustrated by this one even as a massive fan of Guy Ritchies...
"The Covenant keeps the attention on the bond and relationship between the two men, and portrays it as a show of humanity amidst the barbaric. [Full review in Spanish]"
"With the men's dynamic and their few words, The Covenant could've been a Western (and in a certain way it is). [Full review in Spanish]"
"The Covenant is also known under its official title Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant, although I suppose a more accurate moniker might be Guy Ritchie’s The Killing Fields."
"Ritchie did not have to put his name in the title of the strongest, most impressive film of his career. It’s a defining showcase that liberates him from his genre. It is Gyllenhaal’s most assured role. A highly realistic war film."
"... uses the real-world experiences of many as inspiration for a dramatic wartime tale in which the bonds forged in battle cannot be undone, no matter time and distance."
Gyllenhaal is good as the intense American sergeant...
The Covenant is a disciplined and effective war movie with a real point to make about the civilian workers who were left behind.
…as entertaining and exciting as it is thought provoking.
"[Gyllenhaal 's] energy is perfect for the relatively sober-minded The Covenant — and allows space for Dar Salim to shine, in a more substantial lead than the majority of his Hollywood roles have afforded him so far. "
"…the film’s second half, largely focused Killing Fields-style on Kinney’s attempts to rescue Ahmed, is the exact opposite of the casual betrayal which took place in real life…"
"Though the movie is fictional, the uncertain fate of thousands of real Afghan interpreters after the hurried 2021 US withdrawal gives it genuine heft."
"Guy Ritchie's strategically shameful action thriller points an accusatory finger at broken covenants (promises) made to loyal Afghan interpreters/translators by the U.S. Government, leaving them stranded as prime targets for Taliban reprisals."
"These set pieces are extraordinarily well done, brutal, and eye-opening to everyday dangers. Still, the final act would have worked better if it dealt with Ahmed's struggle to survive rather than Kinley's guilt and depression."
The serious melodrama falters when it becomes little more than an action movie devoid of the melodrama.
A searing war drama with considerable edge-of-your-seat moments.
This feels like a breath of fresh air [for Guy Ritchie]. He is really reinvigorated by paring it down. 
"Like two films in one, this “Covenant” doesn’t seem like other examples, even though Ritchie embraces plenty of clichés. It works because the actors commit to the missions."
"The reunion brought tears to my eyes--Guy Ritchie’s seasoned filmmaking career has created an excellent film of friendship, devotion, and the realistic horrors of war."
Director Guy Ritchie dispenses with his usual fancy flourishes and keeps the action straight-forward...He ratchets up the tension as the urgency mounts in a cut-to-the-chase scenario that gives a sense of real-time heroics.
"It's essentially a male-bonding story about two unlikely comrades saving each other's asses, and the screenplay does its due diligence by addressing the psychological trauma they endure. "
"A capably made but simple-minded rescue film, one with a big heart — even if it could have used more brain."
Ritchie surprises with a much more conventional action movie. Dar Salim is excellent in this stripped-back soldier story that is more poignant than the trailers suggested.
"In theory it is all there - the acting, the story, the direction - but it never seems to completely come together."
"Like just about every Guy Ritchie work, Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant isn’t all it could have been. It deserves to be seen, though, and, at least for a while, remembered."
The perfect two person story. 
"The intensity of the men's predicament might have been better served by Peter Berg or Paul Greengrass, both of whose frenetic styles more aptly fit the material."
"The action scenes are well-staged, and there is plenty of suspense in the rescue scenes, too. Gyllenhaal, one of the best actors of his generation, shines in this role. He plays a man more haunted than idealistic."
This gripping look at war gets under your skin.
That Salim and Gyllenhaal are so good almost seems like an afterthought because Ritchie has us too involved in their characters' plight to get distracted by the artifice.
"A deadly serious—and almost deadly earnest, in its portrait of duty, honor, and sacrifice—look at America’s failure to live up to its word to the interpreters on the ground in Afghanistan."
It’s Gyllenhaal and Salim that make the movie leave a dent in the viewer long after the credits conclude. As men cut from a more similar cloth than either would like to admit-they’re both family men serving in a war-they make the quieter moments count.
"It is as always important to reassure Americans that we at least mean well with our pointless destructive wars, not like “bad” countries... A person predisposed to believe that might find The Covenant enjoyable. I did not."
"This is Ritchie at his most sedate and naturalistic, which makes sense in the context of this story."
The Covenant doesn’t arouse the stirrings of fervor that many war movies tap into but neither is it a nihilistic descent into the inhumanity of battle.
"""A taut military thriller with two fantastic performances, Guy Ritchie's The Covenant brings to mind the Afghans we left behind."" "
"Swinging back to a more serious register, Ritchie presents his first film grounded in harsh real-world politics, and it’s the best film he’s made in years."
"Through the Herculean efforts of Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim, Guy Ritchie’s THE COVENANT is a gripping film exposing the horrors of the Afghanistan War."
Guy Ritchie’s THE COVENANT is two hours of pure adrenaline as we wait for this remarkable story to unfold. It's a highly emotional journey that is impossible to dismiss. 
A dour lecture punctuated by some rousing action sequences.
"The Covenant is a solid story of survival, respect, and honor, while still acknowledging the brutality and senselessness of war. It’s easy to get caught up in this journey, and one of Ritchie’s better recent efforts."
"The director, coming off a run of successful action comedies, shifts into a moving but flawed tale of friendship in the war in Afghanistan."
"The Covenant is nowhere near the ultimate cinematic statement on what happened in Afghanistan, but it is a riveting story worth telling from that battlefield. "
What we get is not only his most restrained and most focused movie in years. I think it’s Ritchie’s best movie in years period.
What gives “Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant” its solid footing is the twinned performances by Gyllanhaal and Salim.
"Guy Ritchie's The Covenant offers an overly simplistic portrayal of an American rescue mission in Afghanistan. However, this action flick has solid performances and capably shows the importance of interpreters during war. "
"An uncharacteristically serious movie by director Guy Ritchie, this war-themed tale is simplistic but sturdy and effective thanks to crisp, energetic filmmaking and a touching emotional core. "
"The least Guy Ritchie film Guy Ritchie has yet made boasts a title bearing his name. Even as Ritchie quiets his quirks, there's still considerable style and scope here. Melancholy, mournful and meaty dramatic filmmaking that's less rah-rah, more requiem."
"Harmful stuff comes with such nasty work, but so does the loyalty, friendship, and mutual respect that filmmaker Ritchie dramatizes just about perfectly after collecting these incidents for the big screen."
Jake Gyllenhaal stars in skillfully made and gripping film...
"The Covenant is a well crafted, action packed and intense drama expertly directed by Guy Ritchie featuring career best acting work from Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim. A film about the bonds of brotherhood that'll move you, enlighten you and uplift you!"
"If you think Guy Ritchie's The Covenant is simply just another movie about war, you are in for a large and pleasant surprise."
"For much of its running time, director Ritchie’s war movie manages to be topical, suspenseful, and moving. But partly because the story is fiction, Ritchie takes a few genre liberties that threaten to undermine the sincerity of his tale."
"Much like Ritchie’s last feature, Mission:Impossible-wannabe Operation Fortune, The Covenant is completely devoid of any of the stylistic tics that once marked the director’s work. "
"The Covenant does merit bonus points for showcasing Salim, a terrific journeyman actor who finally has a meaty role in an American movie. "
"Ritchie pulls off the best film of his career in nearly 20 years thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal and his own no-fuss, no-muss approach to mean-and-lean filmmaking and storytelling."
"This is not a true story. The truth is a disgrace. A throwback to those Chuck Norris ""Missing in Action"" films.  Gyllenhaal and Salim are fine. But this film is a fraud."
Contains some of the most poetic imagery that Ritchie’s ever filmed
"While the battle scenes are effective and visceral, I yearned for the dialogue to have a little more of the color and life that Ritchie’s known for. Most of the movie sounds like someone entered “Write a war movie” into ChatGPT."
"This is a tense war drama, given more gravitas from the stellar performances of Gyllenhaal and Salim. As it goes along, it becomes a metaphor for the long slog that the U.S. got themselves into, as the “longest war” just ended recently. Good for? NOTHING!"
"It’s a more than welcome break from Ritchie’s usual in-your-face style and suggests that Ritchie, just months away from turning 55, has finally matured as a filmmaker."
"A muscular, overwrought war film."
"Guy Ritchie is only one of a handful of directors known for a signature style. But he abandons it in ""The Covenant,"" a pretty straightforward but solidly executed war story. "
... resonates most powerfully by finding a fresh perspective on familiar themes of brotherhood and loyalty along the front lines.
"A sober military thriller that excoriates Joe Biden’s decision to pull out of Afghanistan in 2021 and, in the process, to strand the thousands of local interpreters who had risked their lives to aid the American cause."
"It’s a dramatically effective action thriller, but “The Covenant” is also an uncomfortably jingoistic combat movie."
"A serious military drama about valor, courage, honor, and the profound devotion of military personnel who serve alongside one another in times of war. Hope to see more spec ops military movies from director Guy Ritchie."
How does it honor these brave and essential people to make a movie that isn’t about any of them but rather a near-superhuman fictional character?
"It’s good to see Ritchie branch out — just like after “Snatch” and “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” he made us all do a double-take with “Aladdin.” Not everything works in “The Covenant,” but he’s not lost in the desert, either.   "
"For all its clichés, this furious and discomfiting film tugs on your conscience for days, making a powerful case to turn the American public’s attention back to a conflict it would rather forget.
"
The Covenant works best when the two leads are forced to be silent lest they tip off prowling combatants. 
"Hardly a revisionist film, either in terms of war movies in general or those about Afghanistan in particular; but as a tale of unlikely wartime comradeship, it’s a strong, compelling piece.  "
"Though possibly well-intentioned, the execution of The Covenant ensures its narrative and thematic potential is drowned out in the roar of gunfire it becomes far too enamored by."
"Guy Ritchie's film cuts through the complications ... to get at something so unquestionable that it is essentially an unmistakable, universal truth."
"Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant delivers the action and suspense expected from the war movie genre and from Ritchie, yet ventures beyond expectations to create a moving drama. "
An oftentimes riveting war film which marks a new path for the 54-year-old filmmaker.
"It’s unclear where this side of Guy Ritchie has been hiding all these years, but the juxtaposition of his regular fare to the well-done drama in The Covenant makes you wonder what else he might be able to do."
Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim are superb in a visceral display of brotherhood on the battlefield. Guy Ritchie's The Covenant leaves no man behind. 
"Gyllenhaal, who’s looking more and more like a trimmer Javier Bardem, uses that handsome-hangdog face of his to good effect. Salim, an Iraqi-born Danish actor, is very good. If he weren’t, the movie simply wouldn’t work."
"Instead of layering on jump cuts, crazy camera angles and jokey subtitles like he usually does, he keeps things calm. Ritchie lets the action unfold swiftly and clearly."
The result is one of Ritchie’s finest films that’s made all the better by two extraordinary performances. 
"An absorbing, action-driven war movie with great performances form Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim. "
The most suspenseful and heartfelt movie in Guy Ritchie's career.
"It about as exciting, gripping and moving as war films get -- especially one set in the murky Afghanistan conflict in which the U.S. found itself immersed for more than two decades."
"Director Guy Ritchie exercises considerable restraint in his depiction of action: again and again, he is content to pull back, hold the shot, and let what happens be enough to engage the viewer. And again and again, it's more than enough."
A masterfully manipulative war thriller...
It's Guy Ritchie’s strongest film in quite some time. He feels at home with the genre and the focus needed to help the audience re-examine whatever feeling they have about the war in Afghanistan. 
Offers marginal entertainment value. It’s a film that seems afraid to offer any ideas about its setting and characters beyond the minimum.  
"Here, working from such familiar modern-warfare sentiment, Guy Ritchie's flash-bang technique becomes just another Hollywood grunt."
"Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant is as sharp on deep human elements as it is with intensity, giving rise to a welcomed change in the director’s repertoire.

"
"The Covenant is more than just a great action movie, it’s a movie with purpose."
"Guy Ritchie's The Covenant is a pulse-pounding and visceral look At keeping a promise, with Jake Gyllenhaal compelling as ever."
"The acting by Gyllenhaal and Dar Sajim, who plays Ahmed, is outstanding and I think no matter your political persuasion you’ll be rooting for these 2 men to save each other."
Ritchie delivers his most mature film yet.  Without relying on his usual bag of tricks he delivers a thrilling and entertaining movie about the lengths two men will go to to do the right thing.
"Outside of universal themes involving friendship, bonding, and bravery, I can’t say the Brit filmmaker is doing much to enlighten me on how he feels about the politics of it all, but his efforts to deliver a strong feature pay off."
"Directed by Ritchie with breathless, propulsive momentum, ""The Covenant"" is really about two wars. There's the one in the battlefield and the other one at home when some soldiers went to great lengths to bring their abandoned interpreters to the U.S.

"
"As premature as it might be to say in a review for an initial theatrical run, Carol more than earns the right of comparison to Brief Encounter in terms of quality. Frankly, it’s one of the new great romantic films."
Todd Haynes delves into the noir-kissed world of Patricia Highsmith...
"These are fractions of instances that straight people can’t see, but inside, we feel our hearts pounding and our minds racing with possibility. That’s what Carol—and the holiday season for that matter—are all about."
... An extraordinary film in every sense. [Full review in Spanish]
Carol is one of the better film adaptions in recent memory and has truly withstood the test of time.
A masterpiece of melancholy longing that manages to miraculously avoid being devastatingly tragic or dramatic.
"Haynes, an experimental filmmaker whose dramatic work may seem straightforward yet is anything but, knows just how to fold his audience into a moment. "
"Todd Haynes and Phyllis Nagy created a compelling, extraordinary tale about love and its meanders in life. The time passes, but Carol remains the most critical romantic story with a happy ending. For me, it will always mean a lot."
"Poised, elegant and desperately moving, it's yet another tour de force turn from an actress who has clearly defined herself as the best of her generation."
"Veering toward moments of heightened drama, Haynes shows measured restraint in maintaining the focus that essentially this is a story about love, rather than heading into cheaper plot devices."
"A gorgeous, complicated and absolutely captivating film."
"The second time I watched Carol all I did was cry. I cried over the scarves and the love-seats, the brooches and Rooney's pinned-up bob, the way Cate Blanchett unfolds her body like angel's wings"
"In the end, the décor, costumes and settings are little more than a backdrop for an affair that does not follow ""a prescribed path."""
A wonderful and all-too-rare film.
An entertaining endeavor and a poignant message about love's ability to overcome adversity.
"Unreasonably chilly and isolating, the central romance never feels believable, but Blanchett's titular performance is a wonderful portrait of manipulation."
"The fragility of the characters and their courtship makes for a compelling tale. There are several layers to the film, and it softly transfixes you, making it a must-watch."
"There comes a point where the melodramatic idyll wears me out, despite the excellent performances from Blanchett and Mara. [Full review in Spanish]"
A good film will tell you everything you need to know. A great film will show you.
"Carol is a timeless love story between two women in 1950s New York with absolutely stellar performances from its cast, beautiful writing from Phyllis Nagy and exquisite craftsmanship from Todd Haynes."
"Haynes' vision of love is not the conquers-all variety, but rather ""we'll muddle through, no matter the cost."" It's a beautiful sentiment, befitting a beautifully constructed film from one of our era's greatest filmmakers."
"[Carol] gets a suitably lush treatment by Todd Haynes, who created a film recalling the best work of that noted 1950's auteur Douglas Sirk."
"Overall, Carol is stunning, compelling and unmissable."
A perfect film. [Full Review in Spanish]
The chemistry amongst the leads is forged into an excellent story by Todd Haynes. [Full Review in Spanish]
"With her striking beauty, sophisticated demeanor, [Cate] Blanchett's amazing characterization lights up the screen."
Achingly precise (and unexpectedly poignant) performances from Blanchett and Mara keeps the whole thing well away from soap-opera territory.
"A major work by a major filmmaker, working at a level of narrative grace and elegance that is almost unmatched in contemporary cinema."
"Every element of Carol serves to complicate, beatify, or forbid the ferocious looks of longing that pass between Blanchett and Mara. The film lives for these moments."
The understanding reached thanks to Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy is of the exquisite and emotionally devastating variety.
"Carol is a brazen love story that is brave enough to be set in another time and place and is passionate as hell. A superbly executed film, most especially in terms of writing and characters."
"Christmas movie: the melancholy, the longing, the flashes of joy and anticipation, the rushes of despair. And, finally, hope - as a new year unfolds and love steps out of the shadows."
"... caressed in soft-focus pastels, the beautiful strangeness of Carol is very much of-a-piece with Haynes's world, even as it expands it."
"If only Carol, the much lauded movie from director Todd Haynes were as good as its trailer, a one minute ten second masterpiece of close-ups, pitch-perfect period detail and barely contained emotion."
"Carol simply oozes class - the look, the narrative, the direction and its performances...making it a most beautiful film not just to behold, but to experience emotionally."
It's Blanchett and Mara who really shine... There is so much beauty in their work. No film has touched me more in 2015 than Carol.
CAROL is an incredibly articulate film in terms of the character moments that are subtle with their execution yet boisterous in their meaning.
It's a joy to see female characters written with such depth and played so achingly well by actors at the top of their game.
"The main problem is that the social tapestry is far, far less interesting than in Far from Heaven."
"Carol filled me with hope and promise, which felt completely unexpected coming from Todd Haynes. Yet there's still a lingering fear in every frame, the presence of facades, gesture and shadow, the feeling of a set of eyes upon you. It's a masterpiece."
"A slow, intellectual, coming-of-age romance, Carol is a stunningly filmed piece of emotionally distant art."
"A luscious and profound piece on relationships, sexuality and repression."
"There are so few movies that dare to build themselves around female leads that Carol comes across as outrageously daring. It should not be, but there we are."
"With a minimum number of words and gestures, Mara conveys the complex inner life of Therese, a young woman in 1950s New York who's trying to understand what it means to fall in love."
"It makes me wish the word ""epic"" hadn't been completely diluted so I could bring the full weight of its meaning to bear on this love story. Extraordinary? Singular? Remarkable? Yes, all of those things too."
"How gorgeous and complex and unforgettable is the world Haynes has created in Carol, and how lovely it is to realize that it might just be our own."
"Carol is a voluptuous, simmering, shimmering, careless whisper of a film that could easily have been written entirely for Cate Blanchett."
"The film is a triumph of art direction and wardrobe, a seductive art object. When Carol tells her husband ""we're not ugly people, Harge,"" she is telling the truth about a film that finds beauty in bad situations."
"Stunningly atmospheric and featuring eye-catching production and costume design, the romance can be stilted at times, but it's hard not to appreciate the cinematic composition in its entirety."
"... the ending, although extensive, moves... [Full review in Spanish]"
The story can be a little over-leisurely in its unfolding but it builds to a powerful finale.
There isn't a single scene that is anything less than stunning to look at
This is a society you will recognise - for Carol goes well beyond Carol.
Underplay and restraint are the strengths of Carol. This is a film that stays clear of dramatisation. It kills you softly.
Not perfect but a must-see for those who like to keep an eye on the serious award contenders.
"Carol is a strange film to parse. It's certainly one of the very best made and well-acted films of the year, but its sum total is cold and reserved."
"Languid and seductive, it's a slow burner with Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett as an exquisitely matched pair."
Carol is a perfect film that will restore your faith in cinema.
"What results is equally tragic and beautiful, highlighting the terrible consequences of societal rejection and stigma."
In the Golden Age of Hollywood-the 1940s and '50s-there was a genre called the 'woman's picture.' Contemporary filmmaker Todd Haynes has become the modern master of the form.
"Cate Blanchett may well be on her way to a third Oscar, and it would not be undeserved. Her Carol is assured, but her consequences are greater, as is the range of emotion Blanchett displays."
[Todd] Haynes remains the consummate filmmaking artist.
Add Todd Haynes' midcentury love story Carol to your list of favorite Christmas-themed films.
I relish this stunningly framed paean to female love but fear something priggish is buried within it.
"Though much of Carol highlights the sexism and rigid social expectations of the time, it's not a preachy film. It's dramatic, certainly, but on a small scale, not a large scale."
"Among the virtues of Todd Haynes's new film, Carol, is the delicacy, the patience, and the sheer amount of screen time that it lavishes on the experience of falling in love."
"I can think of no better way to describe Carol to others - it is so powerful, so important, so real and alive that it makes you forget it's not happening to you."
"So enraptured was I by the look of the movie, I was almost able to overlook the fact that we don't actually get a lot of dialogue between the two women."
"To call Carol a Christmas miracle feels like a gaudy understatement, but that's sort of exactly what it is."
"A film for anybody who has ever fallen in and out of love, dealing with hopeless infatuation and the slow transition to the messy reality that all but threatens to burn out the initial spark, Carol is more than just a gorgeously crafted period piece."
What Haynes gets so perfectly right with this film really is the very specific sense of time and place.
"Everything is so perfectly beautiful in Carol, director Todd Haynes' '50s melodrama, that it more closely resembles a museum diorama than a movie -- until its luminous stars, Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, breathe life and passion into it."
The smile of recognition and understanding that closes things out is an unforgettable celebratory stunner that shook me right to my very core.
This is a slender movie that Haynes gives plenty of antique atmosphere.
A love story of sublime subtlety where the smallest encounters have the most consuming impact.
"Carol is a sensuous, enchanting piece of work which vividly and realistically recreates the 1950s in American in a new way -- never seeming twee or idealised."
"Carol tracks the slow-burn of romantic agony, with the added weight of a closet the size of the world."
"A showcase for the towering talents of Blanchett and Mara, Carol is a sumptuous watch."
Never has the impossible glamour of Cate Blanchett been used to better effect than in Todd Hayne's ravishing and romantic Carol.
A wondrously beautiful piece of filmmaking by American director Todd Haynes.
"Though it's certainly a two-woman show, Carol finds room to be impossibly generous to very nearly every human being who appears onscreen."
One of this year's best films.
"A movie that adheres to the Hollywood canons, impeccably shot and crafted and a strong presence by Blanchet and Mara. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"'Carol' feels like the third part of a loose trilogy of films set in the past, about women who are trapped by the confines of their time."
Carol is a dizzyingly romantic love story that will appeal to any filmgoer.
"In their story set in the past, there lies possibility, which is what infuses Carol and Haynes's best work generally, the transcendence of being and becoming yourself."
"I value Haynes as an artist, but his art isn't revelatory or emotional; it signifies feelings rather than sharing them."
"The period trappings remain impeccable throughout, crackling even when the script doesn't."
"The torment is captured well enough in the faces of the actors, their characters locked inside an indifferent, inhospitable world."
"A perfectly acted, perfectly sculpted, perfectly rounded exploration of love and strife in the not-so-perfect '50s."
"The film still makes the viewer swoon, its heady mood of love and longing generated by the briefest of glances and gestures."
"As he did with his gloriously realized 2002 domestic drama Far From Heaven, director Todd Haynes once more brings a story of how, in the pursuit of dreams, even happy endings can come with collateral damage."
"The rhythm is slow but the film is never boring, this is a story worthy of seeing in the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Carol is a truly striking cinematic achievement, artfully exploring themes that resonate still with powerful force today."
"Carol is a movie worth watching to understand its main theme without fear of censorship, and most of all, to realize and understand that love is love regardless of genre. [Full Review in Spanish]"
What Carol captures more specifically than the thrill of a romantic encounter is the act of remembering only to forget.
"This is pure cinema, which through its artistry opens a window into the souls of its characters and admittedly opens the closed windows of its viewers as well."
"Carol is a n excellent film, full of warmth and romance."
"In spite of being Hannes' less ambitious cinematic film, Carol offers the experience of putting you in the shoes of it's characters and feel what they feel. [Full review in Spanish]"
"An elegant, profound, meassured and extraordinary crafted film. Blanchett and Mara are hypnotic. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Yes, Donnie Yen plays another blind character (my theory is that filmmakers do this because nobody would buy that a Donnie Yen with two functioning eyes could ever lose a fight)."
"You might have seen some of it before, but it has never been as big and brash as it is in this chapter... an action epic for the ages."
Genuine cinematic poetry.
John Wick 4 is the ultimate action movie.
"The action is fluid and all-consuming and makes it easy to overlook some of the story’s shortcomings (too many new threads, not so seamlessly woven in). "
It is an incredible ride that is designed to entertain from the opening moments and the best way to enjoy it is to just hang on.
"This series always did a stellar job of not turning John Wick into a robotic machine, and Reeves always maintained a depth to this haunted character. The tenderness of a classically Reeves-ian performance is what is missing in John Wick: Chapter 4. "
"They understand that it is the characters, the humour, and the jaw-dropping action that keeps us coming back for more. And as long as they keep this up, even in the form of spin-offs, audiences will continue to lap it up."
John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers a satisfying conclusion to an outstanding action franchise that never fails to impress with its stylish action sequences and portrayal of an intriguing world of assassins and codes of conduct.
Joins both Mad Max and Mission: Impossible in the action franchise hall of fame in the wing of films that somehow keep getting more thrilling and more beautiful to look at amidst the ballet of carnage in its breathless set pieces.
"John Wick: Chapter 4 concludes the game-changing saga with a relentless, ruthless action masterclass that ultimately justifies its epic length."
"""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is the best entry since the original, and it knows the mileage on John's soul is starting to reveal itself more and more. So, it smartly plans for a narrative exit ramp."
Keanu Reeves and Chad Stahelski return with trusted collaborators to their neon labyrinth featuring elevated action and a cast of adversaries and allies to create the most John Wick film in the franchise. 
"The entire series is a sisyphean journey of revenge. The audience knows that John Wick (Keanu Reeves) can never be free from this life of an assassin. He’s doomed to climb that 222-step staircase to Sacre-Cœur in Paris, both physically and metaphorically."
"A Bonafide Action MASTERPIECE. 

Cementing John Wick as one of the greatest Action Franchises of all time. Once you think you’ve seen the coolest sequence it only gets better up until the final 30 minutes which completely had my jaw on the floor."
"With John Wick Chapter 4, Chad Stahelski crafts a grand sculpture of gunplay, feverishly yet methodically chiseled until its ultimate, explosive completion. A violent, ferocious symphony that encapsulates the very reason why we go to the movies. "
"From the cinematography, an atmospheric score in all the right places, to a powerful conclusion in Wick’s personal’s story – it ends the franchise in the best way it ever could."
"John Wick: Chapter 4 doesn’t feel like the fourth film of a franchise; it’s an exclamation point, a high watermark for action cinema as a whole."
"The world’s most deadly wife-guy returns to inflict his brand of elaborately choreographed mayhem on anyone that’s left to get in his way. If we have indeed seen John Wick’s final headshot, it’s a well-executed conclusion."
"... in epic fashion, everything that occurred before has led to this exact destination, creating within the narrative a sense of pre-destination and inevitability."
"Sensational stunts, rigorous physical blocking and camera choreography, judicious but satisfying gore, and an incongruous nod to Frogger—good stuff, Mr. Wick."
"This might be the most impressive John Wick film since the original, one that balances its bombastic fight sequences with plenty of compelling lore and surprising emotion. Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins steal the show."
The best film in the John Wick action collection.
"John Wick: Chapter 4 is effective in every aspect, even when it demonstrates its faults at a full glance."
"As a franchise, John Wick offers viewers a lot and does it well.  The 4K release lives up to expectations and is a must for any John Wick fan."
"By trading brains for bullets and characters for puppets, the director made the worst possible choices for this exhausting fourth chapter."
"John Wick: Chapter 4 packs in everything we love about John Wick, from high style to mysterious assassins to dogs to car chases to foot chases to a Looney Tunes level of gunplay. It’s the whole kitchen sink tossed on fire into oncoming traffic."
The latest installment of the John Wick franchise offers a vast canvas for stunt work and action choreography with a sincere and brooding Keanu Reeves as the anchor.
"The film’s runtime is probably its greatest flaw, but watching Wick and Yen battle it out is well worth the price of admission."
"I can’t say whether John Wick: Chapter 4 is better or less-good than the other Wicks, but it’s easily the funniest – and that reflects the restless creativity of its makers. "
The John Wick series comes to an anti-climactic and thoroughly interminable close with this absolutely endless entry...
An exhilarating action film that takes itself and its bizarre world seriously.
"Not sure exactly how badly we needed a fourth John Wick installment, but it is always a fun ride."
This pulp one was more entertaining than the others in the series.
"While Tom Cruise is jumping bikes off a ramp in Norway, Reeves is whipping reverse 180s on a famous circle drive in Paris while shooting bad guys. That’s him doing just about every ounce of stunt work and fight choreography. He’s in a league of his own. "
"The whole arc, with its excesses and ridiculousness, ends up closing –but above all, it seems to condense– not only the leit motifs of the saga, but almost everything that has been choreographically action cinema of the last 20 years."
"Translation: We can consider ourselves fortunate, because this self-aware delight, committed to the cause of relentless entertainment, has transformed cinematic action into a true work of art."
"The fight scenes are so kinetic, so recklessly energetic and just so much fun that the three hours fly by like so many bullets whizzing past Wick’s head. "
Please don't stop making John Wick movies anytime soon.
"John Wick: Chapter 4 benefits by knowing what it is and holding fast to what works. Clean visuals, blistering action, streamlined plot progression, and cutting-edge stuntwork."
"John Wick 4 is a masterclass in action movies. Chad Stahelski brings his absolute best game to this film, with action sequences that leave you in awe. 

With incredible stunts, sets and cinematography, it’s one of the best films of the year thus far. "
"Sit back, relax, mind the language, and see fight scenes to dazzle the eye."
"John Wick: Chapter 4 is not just the magnum opus of the series, it actually corrects a problem that the series has had for a while, a question we haven’t had an answer for over the last couple of films.

What does John Wick want?"
"“John Wick: Chapter 4” is by far the strongest film of the franchise with some of the best action in film history. The rewatchability factor will demand multiple viewings, and after seeing this movie, your eyes and mind will never be the same."
It's up to par with all the other films in the franchise. There were moments when you could laugh. Moments where you could cry. Highly enjoyable!
Its less like a [three-hour] fight sequence and more like an incredibly bonkers ballet
"The best film in the series, featuring four or five action set pieces that are breathtaking."
"There isn’t much dialogue because there never is in a movie involving hitman Wick. Once again, Keanu Reeves plays him with as much taciturn moodiness as possible. He’s sullen, silent, and strong through 169 relentlessly supercharged minutes."
"""John Wick 4"" hits the mark. This grand ballet of mayhem and ultra-violence goes on a bit too long but is never dull. The story threads aren’t the most complex, but Keanu and friends commit to the action and it’s stellar. 
"
"Clocking in at a hefty 169 minutes, the fourth Wick movie spreads its wings and goes full-blown epic. Every single shot is a dazzler, it has a surefooted pace, and the simple story is elevated to mythical status."
"... Overkill in more ways than one. All that said, there are some extraordinary fight sequences, leavened with cherishable wit."
"I wasn't sure the Wickiverse could ever top ""knife museum"" but then they handed our man John a pair of nunchucks and...well..."
"I wasn't sure the Wickiverse could ever top ""knife museum"" but then they gave our man John a pair of nunchucks and...well..."
"No matter how a John Wick movie finishes, it ends with viewers wanting more — and this is no exception, including more of Yen as Caine alongside Keanu."
Who knew the Wickiverse was a (murderous) utopia?
"A nearly three-hour orgy of mayhem that’s flashy, raucous, brainless and as nutritious as a Twinkie.  But fans will eat it up and, like Oliver Twist, ask for more.  Others might feel not just glutted by the excess but somewhat nauseated by it."
"If there were an Oscar for ""best headshot effects"" this movie would win it.  And its over the top, senseless and overly long plot would lost it every other accolade possible."
"Emphasizing spectacle over substance at every slow-motion turn while trying to constantly outdo itself, this ambitious sequel feels like a director’s cut that could have benefited from some judicious trimming."
The strongest chapter in the Wick saga and of the best Hollywood action films of all time! The magnetic characters -especially Donnie Yen- anchor the brutal and beautiful torrent of mayhem. [Full Review in Spanish]
"One last fever dream of violence and mayhem, giving viewers a final chance to watch John Wick seek the kind of revenge on the wealthy and all-powerful that we all dream about."
"The Godfather II of action movies. Blisteringly entertaining, and packed with some of the best action and fight sequences ever put on film"
"Somehow retains the sense of basicness that led the original to such prominence, whilst layering itself with the operatic expansion of its near-video game-like ultimation."
It's a fantastic finale (maybe) for a favorite franchise.
John Wick: Chapter 4 is still entertaining. [Full review in Spanish] 
The fourth film in the very entertaining John Wick series delivers lots more action and even some affecting consequences.
"Energised by a swaggering electro-rock score, this is pulp cinema at its most giddy and gleeful."
Bring on the stunt people- John Wick is back in town.
"An absolutely excellent, masterful final lap for the series with Reeves dedicating himself to the action movie art form."
"This installment of the series offers nearly three hours of action, humor (a 4DX bonus), and sweeping landscapes. All come with high kill and diversity scores. There's also an Easter egg for East Asians."
"John Wick: Chapter 4 is explosive, nunchuck-bashing, bone-crunching cinematic ecstasy that allows action junkies to gorge on a buffet of bullet casings and broken necks."
"It's impossible not to applaud the audacity in opening the movie with a reference to Lawrence of Arabia and ending it with one to The Warriors, not fearing comparison despite the prejudice with which the genre is seen by many. [Full review in Portuguese]"
"A brutal fourth installment, which offers the right dose of action almost at the same level as the previous chapters. [Full review in Spanish]"
"John Wick: Chapter 4 did not need to be nearly as long as it is, but in this case, the excess is the point. Much of it is ridiculous and ridiculously violent, but it’s also highly entertaining, which is all you can hope for from this type of film."
"After this installment, it’s hard to see how another sequel would even be necessary beyond Reeves and Stahelski challenging themselves to make something close to one of the greatest action spectacles of all time."
"Chapter 4 is resoundingly the best Wick sequel – but I still prefer cold-blooded efficiency over bloody excess, no matter how artfully and, at times, playfully staged."
"Aside from spectacular fights, it really doesn't have much else to recommend it. There is little character development, and the story is kind of loopy. But you know what you are going to get with this kind of film, and it does deliver what it promises."
"The meal itself is entertaining and a testament to stunt craft, but it's probably the weakest of the franchise in terms of overall success. Thankfully, that's still good enough."
"Caps off what I think we have to regard, at this point, as the best and most-consistent action franchise in American cinema history."
The first  great blockbuster of 2023 and one of the greatest action films I've ever seen.
"This movie did not disappoint, and the bar was high... It's creme of the crop premier action. "
"JWC4 is an elaborately choregraphed, gorgeously crafted slaughter fest. A blood-thirsty spectacle. A circus of scoundrels fighting to the death in the most gracefully violent ways."
"It's wild and bombastic...from a directional standpoint, I think this is Stahelski's best work so far in the series. "
"[Is the film] a profoundly inane exercise in empty violence or a transcendent ballet replacing exposition with movement? ... To quote Wick, ""Yeah."""
" Way cool, and way too damned long."
"Whatever happens next, Reeves and co have their work cut out to top John Wick: Chapter 4."
"Just think: All this carnage, all this fun, all for the want of a dog. Few can beat that."
It’s a great way to spend an afternoon at the cinema and worth the price of admission.
"The final 45 minutes of the film includes three set pieces that, while interesting and certainly fun to watch, frequently push the laws of probability and physics far beyond their breaking points."
"John Wick: Chapter 4 won’t win over any doubters, but it will please the fans. If it is the end to the films series (a TV show is in the works), this caps off a thrilling and consistently entertaining franchise in the best way it can. "
They give John Wick nunchucks in this one. That's my review of 'John Wick Chapter 4.'
"It was such a thrilling, immersive experience. With its high octane action and breathtaking stunt choreography."
"A tantalising offering to an already solid franchise. Slick action, scrumptious visuals and top tier cast additions made this an epic ride!"
"No easy feat for a franchise that’s attempted to top itself with each subsequent film, but Chapter 4 celebrates everything that’s made these movies work so well for this long."
It's unrelenting and relentless... it is epic. 
"Reeves gives more of the super-chill guy we love, though the most fun looks to be had by Skarsgard whose Marquis dresses in immaculate costuming. He camps and vamps through his role."
"Across an enormous running time, the film builds up a compelling tale of revenge and redemption that's unusually involving. And of course it looks fabulous, with colourful design touches and outrageously intricate fight choreography."
"Almost 10 years later, the John Wick franchise is still delivering the most unbelievable action sequences in film in recent years. This time around the universe building is more important than the otherwise bland main character. [Full review in Spanish]"
Nearly three hours of John Wick? You’re gonna need a bigger popcorn.
"Interesting elements [are stretched] far too thin with bloated, excessive fighting sequences ... The gratuitous violence and commando shooting do not offend me, but the film's superfluous, meandering runtime certainly does."
Everything you'd want out of an action movie!
I think it's a fantastic storyline but it may have taken it a step too far to be believable for me.
"Better Watch Out is the definition of a horror comedy, with great performances all around."
"Better Watch Out is a fun, surprisingly emotional horror movie experience."
Better Watch Out is a festive treat all year round. And you'd better watch it.
"Better Watch Out is like a puzzle that horror fans get to dissect, which makes it a true joy to watch. Even better, it's a movie that demands you react to it. You'll laugh. You'll yell at characters. You'll cringe."
A reminder that sometimes films can misbehave and there's nothing wrong with that. [Full review in Spanish].
"The pretensions of 'Better Watch Out' are modest, but for what it pretends to do it does a great job. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Sharp direction, snappy dialogue, clever comedy, tasty looking pizza and a game-changing twist all come together to create a fun, creepy and entertaining holiday horror movie."
"Most notably, a merry-minded macabre middle finger to the Yuletide season in the charmingly twisted and creatively corrosive suburban home invasion horror thriller 'Better Watch Out'."
Better Watch Out is a joyous festive horror treat.
Better Watch Out breaks the mold of the typical holiday slasher and is sure to be on everyone's holiday must-watch list. It takes what audiences love about the holidays and everything they love about horror to create a fun new Christmas movie.
Provides a fun twist on the home invasion sub-genre that should give horror fans a hilariously disturbing viewing experience.
"Better Watch Out goes to completely unexpected and(...)gruesome places. The nasty shocks are off-set by treading the always tricky horror/comedy line with wit aplomb, thanks to a cocky, confident script by Kahn and director Chris Peckover."
"Better Watch Out is a fresh, snarky, twisted horror that's a perfect addition for the holiday season."
"It may be gimmicky and nasty, but it's also an enjoyable freak-out."
...a disappointing misfire.
"Though occasionally unsurprising, it joins Krampus and Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale as a strong alternative to the regular holiday viewing because of the nasty genre thrills it delivers whilst being wickedly funny."
"In Better Watch Out, [director Chris] Peckover has succeeded in creating a truly chilling horror which, I hope, will generate plenty of talk this Christmas."
"If Better Watch Out was a Yuletide beverage, it'd be spiked eggnog: you think you know what you're getting, but after a couple of sips it turns out to be something very different."
"... Better Watch Out is a delightfully nasty seasonal inversion, replete with carollers, decorations, themed jumpers and booze."
"An interesting take on the home invasion model it's well acted, tongue in cheek, often funny and although not terrifying provides a few jumps and more than the average number of surprises."
"Clever, mean-spirited, gleefully unpleasant, Better Watch Out is an efficiently nasty Yuletide comic horror that operates as a sort of anti Home Alone."
"Once everything's been unwrapped, Chris Peckover's film isn't the greatest movie anyone could wish for, but it's bright and vicious enough to please the audience to which it's proffered."
The clever Better Watch Out finds a fresh way to add some unwholesome fun to the holiday season.
"A Yule-themed comedy horror that is neither funny, nor particularly horrifying, Better Watch Out feels like a malicious spin on Home Alone."
"Better Watch Out, directed and co-written by Chris Peckover, is a clever horror film that gets cleverer"
An ingenious and efficient black-comic shocker unfolding in real time over one seasonal evening in a prosperous American home.
"The idea is interesting, but the execution is too tacky to make it fly."
"... an exploitative, silly and thoroughly unpleasant affair, with a premise that defies credibility."
A Christmas horror-comedy - and one of the best since Gremlins.
"This is an appropriately mean-spirited, reasonably original, horror movie that's lacking one major thing: gore."
A Christmas cult classic is born: and it's going straight to Santa's naughty list.
"The young cast are all great, particularly Miller, coming off the disastrous Pan a few years ago. Hidden behind a squeaky voice and skinny jeans, Miller finds a balance of childlike innocence and balances it with a dash of privilege."
"While the film is more cartoonish than psychologically believable, it's willing to go to some genuinely uncomfortable places."
"Working within a heavily codified structure, [Peckover has] found a way to keep it fresh and exciting."
"Every detail in this film has been beautifully realised, giving it a timeless quality that's likely to make it a seasonal favourite to rival Die Hard. It's one Christmas treat you can look forward to whether you've been naughty or nice."
"...[for] a good jolt and moderate comedy-gore, this is well worth catching."
The best twist on the 'home invasion' thriller that the sub-genre has seen in a while.
"Blessedly short, but it remains memorable, delivering a punchy cinematic experience and a holiday rug burn for those who felt ""Home Alone"" played it too safe."
"A ho-ho-home invasion yarn which deliciously subverts the genre, this Yuletide horror is an impressive piece of work, bolstered by some memorable performances and a truly unique mid-point twist."
"Violence, language, drinking in snarky, twisty thriller."
"Starts out as one kind of unpleasant, then switches gears to a higher level of unearned nastiness."
[Better Watch Out] is a silly-to-serious film that's sure to enter the canon of Christmas movies for people who prefer a bit of arsenic laced into Santa's cookies.
"If you want to gift yourself a holiday film that decks the halls with blood, this is one to put under the tree."
"The twists and turns of the plot, the occasional ""jump out at you"" moments and a story that is like a demented ""Home Alone,"" make for a solid horror/humor package for the fans."
"Not only does Better Watch Out defy expectations, but it surpasses them."
"A consistently surprising and unusually well-acted thriller, which says pertinent things about suburbia, holiday entertainment and toxic masculinity."
"It's scary and fun, if your idea of fun involves occasional gore and torture, things like that. Plus: Christmas decorations!"
"Olivia DeJonge carries the film on her shoulders, even in sock feet. She's asked to act the film's most emotional sequences with duct tape over her mouth!"
"Chris Peckover's Christmas horror comedy is a deft melding of ""Scream"" and ""Home Alone"" that takes a surprisingly nasty turn in its last act...he really excels in his direction of his young cast"
"Just another depressing, nihilistic horror flick."
"Both the screenplay and the editing maintain the intricate plate-spinning required to go back and forth between laughs and screams, all the while imperceptibly boosting the tension as the night progresses."
Better Watch Out plays the audience at their own game. It pleasures and punishes them for trying to pre-guess its gifts. It is deeply unnerving and adorably sinister.
"Basically, if you're looking for Home Alone with a bit of a darkened edge to it, Better Watch Out will have you decking all your horror-fied halls later this year."
"a tensely un-merry Christmas, painted in yellow and red, that impishly plays upon the audience's most naturally ingrained sympathies. It is also darkly funny from the get-go."
"The overall structure and final surprise may be commendable on an intellectual level, but not an emotional one."
"Avoid spoilers, avoid trailers, and go in to ""Better Watch Out"" completely blind. You'll thank me later."
"The innocence of Home Alone meets jingle bell schlock, and while Zack Kahn's story isn't wholly unpredictable, what plays out still subverts typical babysitter-in-peril tropes (enough)."
Seems destined to become one of those Yuletide perennials for people who like their holiday-themed entertainment as perversely un-wholesome as possible.
"Best described as Home Alone meets Michael Haneke's Funny Games, the sadistic horror comedy Safe Neighborhood is the kind of film that's tough to categorize but easy to enjoy."
"[Miller] is, in key moments, mesmerising to watch."
"You might think you're in for an icky, misogynist torture porn, and momentarily wish to leave the theater. (I did.) But stick it out, because the film will continue to defy your expectations."
"Safe Neighborhood is a rarity that pairs immense entertainment with dark, vicious thrills."
"The reason why I'm nervous to talk too much about it is because one of the movie's biggest strengths is having the audience constantly wondering where the line is drawn, and wondering what each character is capable of."
"This is no cheap bait-and-switch, but a careful rebalancing between real malice and cartoon craziness."
"Who are the Avengers if they don't need to ""avenge"" anymore? Avengers: Endgame shows us our favourite heroes like we've never seen them before."
"Avengers: Endgame surpasses all expectations. One of the best comic-book films of all time, without a single doubt."
"Your level of enjoyment depends on how invested you are in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If you've been with [the franchise] since 2008, ""Endgame"" is an unparalleled experience – unlike anything that has come before and may ever come again."
Avengers: Endgame is not just a culmination of the last eleven years of the Marvel Studios cinematic saga but also a celebration of everything people have come to love about these characters.
"I’m not sure if I would call the great completion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe the best comic book film of all time. Still, it’s certainly the finest conclusion to a greater ideal Hollywood has ever put together."
"From the very beginning “Avengers: Endgame” feels like something special, something unique, something unlike anything we’ve seen before. And even in its missteps it never loses that sense of spectacle and grandeur."
Who could have anticipated that Marvel Studios and Disney would release a three-hour extravaganza whose exquisite character-focused scenes outshine the FX-driven action?
"Eleven years of Universe building, and this is the crescendo. It really pays off, I've never seen anything quite like it. "
"Avengers: Endgame broke me, put me back together, and decided to cut me again in one of the most impactful cinematic experiences of all time. "
"For me, it didn't fulfill the promise of Infinity War, but it did fulfill the promise of the previous twenty movies."
"I'm just grateful to have the privilege to watch this along with the rest of the world. It's not perfect, but it has been one hell of a ride."
"Here's the other really neat thing about Endgame: it made me think of priorities in life and what or who is worth sacrificing for, especially loved ones..."
The true superteam event releases marked something slightly different and spectacular...End Game over the original Guardians by a hair...
This goes beyond the usual scale.
A film that somehow manages to be as epic as fans hope and as dramatic as the MCU deserves.
"Films don't come any huger than this: the closing chapter to an 11-year saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, told across some 22 movies. And by the end of its three-hour runtime, there will definitely be tears."
There really is very little that could be improved about Endgame. There's certainly no more that could be thrown at it.
"So much of the art form is about storytelling, and bringing so many side stories and characters to a satisfying conclusion is tough, and the film blended a (rather) unpredictable plot with emotional character beats deftly..."
"Avengers: Endgame is everything Marvel fans could want and more. It will be interesting to see how the MCU moves into the future after the events in the film, but woe be upon anyone who doubts their ability to adapt and succeed mightily."
I found Avengers: Endgame wonderfully satisfying.
There are [Marvel] movies that have been just as entertaining and a lot smarter than this one.
"Feels like the end of the old cycle, the beginning of a reset. Old favourites gone, passing the mantle to others before they go. We even see a poster that reads, ""Where do we go, now that they're all gone?"""
"The MCU is the ultimate long game, and Endgame feels like its glorious final lap."
"Terms like masterpiece and game-changer are often thrown around a bit hastily, but not on this occasion."
"The fight scenes, while chaotic and intermittently exhilarating, are unable to avoid repetition; such is the nature of invincible entities dueling other invincible entities."
"""Avengers: Endgame"" was a wonderful surprise, filling almost every minute (all 181 of them) with excitement, drama, humor, and visually interesting and entertaining intrigue."
What The Russo Brothers did here is take high expectations and blow them out of the water with an emotionally thrilling finale. Get ready to be moved!
The only thing that I know for sure has ended with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is my patience.
"Endgame is nothing short of a deserved send-off to the Infinity Saga, stamping an impressive mark on the cultural psyche. It has been one hell of a ride."
"Part of the journey is the end, and this one is perfect for certain characters. An unprecedented movie in film history, and a very difficult feat to repeat. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Neither the best nor the worst of times in the franchise, it's a bit like a sugar rush. Endgame delivers both epics highs and a following crash that leaves you feeling oddly empty."
"It's that the movie itself is overblown and half-baked, and without the audience, it's something of a glorified in-joke."
"If Infinity War wanted to blow you away, Endgame wants to punch you in the gut and leave you a speechless, quivering wreck."
"The 22nd installment is a fittingly epic, three-hour finale that packs all of the fan service you could ever want, laced with somber tones and emotional payoffs that will cause even the genre's biggest detractors to shed a tear."
"It's one of the funniest movies of the 20-plus in the franchise, but it's also the one that made me the most emotional. But more than anything, it left me satisfied and thrilled that I kept watching them through the years."
"For fans of the most successful franchise in movie history, Avengers: Endgame delivers the world - and more."
"Epic and spectacular, an emotional rollercoaster that none of us will ever forget."
Avengers: Endgame is the most 'superhero movie' superhero movie ever made.
"The film is almost three hours long; long enough to tie up loose ends, as well as give foundation to a new generation of Avengers. When all is said and done, this was the hardest goodbye in the Marvel Universe."
"A genuine, spectacular, and moving love letter from the Marvel family, the world of comics and the Russo brothers to modern pop culture. [Full review in Spanish]"
A good movie with a breathtaking third act for any comic book fan.
"While there are a few ho-hum moments, there are equally stunning, stirring, triumphant ones where it's damn near impossible not to cheer."
"Overall, Endgame was a satisfying high-stakes adventure that was at times even unpredictable."
Avengers: Endgame is a masterfully triumphant epic. It's a superhero film on a scope and scale the likes of which we've never seen.
"It puts my heart racing like a locomotive in some of the most spectacular sequences I have seen in this cinematic universe that, apparently, closes a cycle to open a new one. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The whole thing is as sentimental as it is exhilarating, but any cheesiness feels well-earned."
"All told, Endgame is a highly satisfying celebration of 10 years of the MCU, and a great bookend to the first three phases."
It was exactly what it needed to be and nothing more.
It was good.
I wouldn't have believed the breezy and tongue-in-cheek Avengers Assemble would evolve into such an odiously self-important endeavour a mere seven years later.
"As fun as the movie is, there's an undeniable hollowness at its core induced by its unwillingness to follow through on certain ideas and symbols."
podcast review
"I'm not naïve enough to suppose that anything I can say here is likely to change anyone's plans about going or not going, so I'll simply say that I enjoyed this silly but thrilling superhero free-for-all."
"You would think they would go back to a time when Thanos was young and vulnerable and off him. They opt for a more intricate approach, which bored me."
Avengers: Infinity War at least had the good taste to abstain from Jeremy Renner. No such luck in Endgame.
"As expected, the film is carried by the original six Avengers, but it does a remarkable job of bringing virtually every memorable character from all 22 movies back onto the screen. It is a staggering reminder of past and present pleasures."
Endgame definitively closes a few chapters in the Avengers saga in highly satisfying fashion. It is a tremendously entertaining intergalactic trip.
"It is this part of the story, the human side, to narrow it down to our marginal planet, that holds the movie together for its three-hour run time."
"Though it takes far too long to get going (the early scenes are needlessly repetitive and this would have been sharper as a 140 minute movie or somesuch), once it's up and running it's full of thrills."
"While the supporting cast members often feel like benched players, the remaining Avengers' arcs do, for the most part, pay off the stories the set up by the film's first hour."
There will never be a Marvel film with an epic feel like this one. [Full Review in Spanish]
"An emotional, fulfilling ride..."
Endgame does what all the great Marvel movies do-it's a fun and funny action movie made by people who are experts at doing just that. But it's impossible not to be frustrated with how Marvel stumbled on the landing...
"...chock full of maudlin eddies that should have been pared back. That said, Endgame gets the job done, passing the baton as it closes out a long-running chapter with some sentimental eye rubs."
"The stakes to deliver a fitting finale to the Infinity Saga are immense. But Avengers: Endgame is so darn satisfying, it will be hard to find a blockbuster that will match its emotionality or excitement."
"To paraphrase Thanos, Oscar nominations are inevitable."
The directing team of Anthony and Joe Russo has found just the right vein of showmanship and self-deprecation to bring the saga to a satisfying close.
I feel like Stan Lee is probably looking down from heaven with a huge smile on his face with Avengers: Endgame
"As the dust clears, Disney stands like Thanos astride Earth-616. They have won, but what kind of world is left behind?"
"Nonetheless, there are a lot of second chances attached to this full stop, and as has usually been the case they're solidly sold. The writing captures individual voices far better than Infinity War did, and the ending is conclusive."
This is a feat of engineering... I felt a sense of catharsis finishing it.
"You wonder how so much talent, underwritten by such an obscenely large budget, doesn't trigger more pathos."
"Avengers: Endgame is a masterpiece which not only delivers on every expectation you had but exceeds ones you didn't even think about. This isn't just a movie, it's an experience."
"Endgame is quite simply everything you need it to be, and everything I wanted it to be."
Avengers: Endgame is REAL great ... with an emphasis on real. Would have been my first 10 rated review ... but they killed my favorite heroes. 'Cheeseburgers...'
Endgame fails its female characters by devaluing them and forgets its characters of color entirely.
It does justice to an ending that's 22 movies in the making.
"Avengers: Endgame is an epic, emotional, spectacle-driven farewell to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it. And the fact that it is so clearly an end is part of the reason it's so successful."
"Avengers: Endgame is almost certainly better than you expect, and far more satisfying and entertaining than its predecessor."
"Avengers: Endgame is better and more nourishing than Infinity War, but it's still the same long con."
"With Avengers: Endgame, it some ways they've made the most adult superhero film yet. Because there are consequences. And things matter."
"To compare to Infinity War, I think that Endgame has the better storyline, the more satisfying conclusion, better conclusion, and much richer emotions."
"[Avengers: Endgame] is a very fitting conclusion to Phase 1, 2 and 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Bring a box of tissues, because it's an emotional roller coaster ride."
Avengers: Endgame doesn't disappoint. There is so much to absorb that one sitting isn't enough.
Avengers: Endgame is both a farewell and a celebration of 11 years of the audacious and wildly successful Marvel Studios experiment. It's very good at both of those things.
Naysayers suggest that Marvel dominance of this cinematic age will one day feel goofy. That opinion is insane. A generation has grown up with these films as their cultural spinal column. They will no more outgrow them than our bodies shed vertebrae.
"Better than it has any right to be, this post-apocalyptic superhero film has significantly more merits than demerits."
"For those of us who have been there from the beginning, the three-plus hours went by without me once looking at my watch. I enjoyed how it delved more deeply into the characters with terrific back-and-forth banter of old friends."
"The late unsuperness of our heroes may be a real guide, a source of hope rather than disappointment."
The entire tone of the film felt like a eulogy to the MCU and relied too heavily on weepy eyed nostalgia and fan service moments to carry it to the end.
"While the experience is bittersweet, the creative team brings everything to a close with a strong, well-meaning and ultimately heartfelt movie."
"It streamlined the narrative and didn't dredge up the bad writing of Age of Ultron, which is always a net positive."
At the end of Endgame is the satisfaction that audiences are witness to an entertaining adventure. [Full Review in Spanish]
'Avengers: Endgame' is a fitting finale for the end of a Marvel era.
The final movie in Marvel's Infinity Saga is a masterpiece. It's an absolute spectacle. It's a love letter to fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Laughs. Tears. Applause. Avengers: Endgame gets all of it.
That it succeeds isn't a surprise... The real surprise -- to the relief of many -- is the level of quality to which this complicated and admittedly busy piece of pop art rises.
It's official. We've been had.
"Endgame is a truly special film, it is the culmination of years of hard work, which was all pieced together with such care and attention, I couldn't help but adore it."
"Sadly, our rating system only goes up to five, because otherwise I'd give ""Avengers: Endgame"" six!"
"The movie is touching and emotional, with great action, friendship, unconditional love and farewell scenes. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Director Denis Villeneuve never misses and succeeds again in this adaptation with incredible performances especially from Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. 
The end result is a movie worthy of the source material.
"an incredibly well-crafted adaptation that's faithful to the source material while also breathing new life into it, and an immersive, epic cinematic journey that will absolutely leave you aching for more."
"Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One is a worthy addition to the collection, besting the Lynch film in certain ways but still flummoxed and frustrated by the source material’s conversation-heavy downside. "
"Dune is a masterful sci-fi blockbuster that is going to please the majority of its audience. The visuals are crying out to be seen on the biggest screen possible, easily becoming the movies standout. "
 A true cinematic treasure that will be cherished for decades to come & gave me the same feeling that I got watching A New Hope for the first time. This is Epic to the highest of standards & I need more right now.
"The talented cast is in service of spectacle, doing little more than providing the expositional sutures that connect one elaborate set piece to the next."
"Dune sets the new standard for epic cinema with eyegamic visuals, powerful sound design and score, and a compelling story surrounded by an absolutely massive scale. Denis Villeneuve adds yet another audiovisual masterpiece to his filmography."
Dune is so engaged in getting the plot right and building an appropriate world that it doesn’t have time to let its characters bond or develop a real connection.
"Villeneuve can build spectacle and innovative tales because we have seen him do it before, but his rendition of Dune isn’t one of them."
"Laced with complex politics, interesting themes on religion, gender, imperialism, and environmentalism; this has just about everything a fantasy/sci-fi fan could want."
"Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is simply epic in every sense of the word, from the acting and action sequences, to the score from Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer. The grandeur of the film is accentuated by captivating shots and landscapes"
"Trust me, on the big screen, the blue is blue enough to bring the intensity when needed..."
"Dune is a true masterpiece. I can’t wait to see how this duology ends, and if Denis Villeneuve sticks the landing, this may be the best science fiction movie of all time. "
"Five years later, the most cogent thought I emerged from Dune with was, ""Hans Zimmer must be stopped."""
"A film is, at its core, a piece of entertainment. While cinema is also a fascinating and diverse macrocosm of art, films like Dune make the case that intermingling approaches to the medium aren’t always possible."
"So people of the world, spice up your life and see Dune. So Villeneuve can conduct the final part of this truly epic space opera."
"A sophisticated sci-fi blockbuster, Villeneuve’s Dune has an epic scope, jaw-dropping action sequences, and stunning visuals."
"Visually epic, but also part of his [Villeneuve's] approach to the screenplay's slow deliberate pace to pull out the novel's more important scenes and storylines."
"From its opening shot to the final fade, I found myself enraptured and transported. "
"The world building and story telling in this film was completely brilliant! Everything had a purpose, and everything was well planned out meticulously. Besides the beautiful cinematography, Hans Zimmer's score shined throughout!"
"There was a lot of things to like about this film but when it ended I couldn't help but say to myself ""Damn that's it?"" - Kennith B. Inge"
"Villeneuve adds his usual brains and soul to yet another epic blockbuster property and, once again, he’s secured victory. But it is us, the audience, who gets to reap the rewards of his hard work."
"What gleams brightest in this take on the tale is its breathtaking visuals, meticulous plotting, a pace that gives the narrative space to breathe and an alluring sense of mystery, as well as the ability to prove simultaneously vast and intimate."
"[Villeneuve] delivered superbly produced entertainment cinema, of visual fortitude, aggrandized form, and banal contemplation. [Full review in Spanish]"
Generational spectacle.
No emotion... just a remarkable tedium. [Full review in Spanish]
"While clearly just the first half of a longer narrative, what a thrilling first half this is. "
"While Dune 2021 is a very well presented and styled gourmet sci-fi dish, for a platter stuffed with ""spice"", it unfortunately lacks a ton of Dune flavor."
"Feels more like an obscure, scattered conversation overheard on a long train ride, peaking early with Rampling’s natural mystique, and then hitting a downward spiral – all dense plot and mild tedium, a bounty of sensual imagery wasted on zero substance."
Paul's family is evidently descended from a long line of matadors.
"The paramount attractions, the visuals, connect immediately. The landscapes, costuming, sets, makeup, creatures and wild special effects are stunning."
"Duna works sometimes like a strange abstract opera in which we perceive more the intensities than the representation of the events, and sometimes not only do we not know what part of the story we are in, but what is concretely happening."
"To promise a whole series of films might be dressed up as a gift for fans, but theres a lingering cynicism about this project  a feeling that its essentially a way of maximising returns at the box office."
"This Dune toys with the idea of genocide, but it’s mostly a movie for people who like to memorize things. All these stupid names, one after another. "
"Dune might not be for everyone; but if you strap in, immerse yourself in the world and go along for the ride, Denis Villenueve delivers a blockbuster sci-fi epic that's regularly jaw-dropping."
"A dishwater war narrative masquerading as sci-fi.
Pshaw."
A blockbuster celebrating the awe-inspiring power of the big screen that everyone can get behind.
"If nothing else, Dune wins its place as a masterpiece of adaptation, truncating roughly half the novel into its runtime to expand the books monomaniacal focus on Paul into a more ensemble narrative."
"Mature yet juvenile, otherworldly yet pleasingly familiar, “Dune” demands to be experienced on the biggest screen you can find (sandworms!)."
"Dune: Part One will leave fans not only wanting, but hoping for more. The spice, in other words, must flow."
Dune is another triumph for Villeneuve and I can’t wait to see him finish his epic.
Denis Villeneuve’s windswept epic is engrossing enough to maintain an audience with an intermission and a running time twice its length.
From the costumes to the enormous machinery and craft of mining spice the film presents a beautifully realised and consistent universe.
Dune falls under a high-brow take on science fiction. It is an entertaining cinematic feat to say the least. The franchise has a bright future.
"""Perhaps the best, or at least the most revealing, thing that can be said about Denis Villeneuves grandly mounted adaptation of Frank Herberts 'Dune' is that he makes it look easy."""
"Many people will encourage you to see new releases on as big a screen as possible. With a masterful spectacle like Dune, its practically a commandment."
Its stateliness is both an asset and a detriment.
"Every few years, a film arrives that changes the landscape of cinema. "
"Dune is an exceptional, big-budget sci-fi spectacle, with amazing production values, high-level acting performances, and grand visuals by director Denis Villeneuve."
"I recognize this film's individual excellence, but its lasting effect may depend on what follows."
"Sure it is long and dense, but the drama of Dune is engaging and it does make the audience care about its characters and stories."
Dune is an experience. Let it wash over you.
Denis Villeneuves adaptation of Dune is a wonder to behold.
"Villeneuve takes a more is more approach here, and that means the scale of this thing is truly epic in the classical sense of the word. But it also means the pacing can feel a bit chaotic."
"With the best Hans Zimmer score of the past decade and endless crisp tableaus of jaw-dropping cinematography, Denis Villeneuve has delivered and then some of his mission to give Frank Herberts pioneering novel due diligence on the big screen."
"Mesmerizing for much of its 3-hour length - especially during its first half, when it prioritizes statecraft and intrigue and augurs and artful arrangements of strangely costumed individuals and strikingly designed alien vessels over fights and chases."
A first chapter to a different kind of space epic that has a maturity to its character that doesn't sacrifice from the spectacle of its action-adventure elements.
"More than any movie this year, Dune gave me hope that big screen, big movies, with big ideas, have a future."
... incredible -- not just Arrakis but the entire production design... its always a little sad when modern audiences can't be trusted with in-story reasons why characters engage in action sequences.
"Though attempts have been made to adapt this work, none seem to have done so faithfully until Denis Villeneuve (Arrival; Blade Runner 2049) with his 2021 release, Dune: Part One, coming available on home video."
"Villeneuve's Dune isn't perfect, but it is impressive."
Villeneuve's proficiency with both intimate human drama and large-scale spectacle makes him an ideal candidate to tackle Herbert's epic
"Dune gives us a reason to celebrate the art of the Hollywood blockbuster for once, instead of condemning it."
"Dune's narrative may be a lot less interesting than everything else around it, but there's little arguing with the mastery of the filmmaking on offer."
"Denis Villeneuve's DUNE is the type of epic filmmaking that many reach for and can't grasp. Full of emotional resonance and with the philosophical core of the book coursing through the film's veins like lifeblood, it puts other franchises to shame."
"Grandiose and enthralling. Dune is a cinematic spectacle powered by an impressive cast, arresting visuals and profound themes. [Full Review in Spanish]"
These are complex dynamics. It's a reason why Dune has been so tough to crack in this medium. I think Villeneuve has done it.
"If they can maintain this level of quality for the sequel, then there's potentially a new powerhouse sci-fi franchise in town."
"When the anticipation is feverish, it sets up movies to disappoint and fail. This long-awaited movie smashes those expectations."
"In Dune, Villeneuve dreams big and boldly."
...a distressing misfire that seems to confirm that Frank Herbert's 1965 novel is just not suitable for big-screen treatment...
"Villeneuve's control of this world, and the sharp precision is wholly compelling enough so that the sheer scope and power of the spectacle feels enough to be thrilling even without answers."
"What it has in spades is an unshakable belief in its own world-building, from a drop of sweat trickling down the ear of a desert rodent to the massive shimmering tsunamis of sand."
"A slow-moving sci-fi epic that's dry, dusty and lacking in spice."
I have a well-documented weakness for sci-fi and expected Dune to feed my soul. I didn't expect it to entirely blow my mind.
"Sense of scale is an interesting thing in science fiction, and it's far better communicated visually than in prose."
"Dune is a triumph of mediocrity. What it does, it does well enough, but was it worth doing? It's a cookie-cutter movie, a restatement of every trope that now impoverishes cinema."
"Villenueve has mistaken humourlessness for seriousness before now, but with a dream cast and a streamlined script, this Dune flies."
"The way Villeneuve repeats ceremonial motifs throughout the film is itself ceremonious. ... Instead of explaining its feudal, courtly world, it immerses the viewer in that world's formalist visual language."
Killer looks only take the show so far in director Denis Villeneuve's high-flown trip into not-so-deep space.
"This is an epic in every sense of the term, and if it's occasionally a little one-note in the thudding portentousness of it all, that's a price Villeneuve is clearly willing to pay."
"The showy effects are also offset by an attention to less expected, human-sized details..."
It's extremely gratifying to see this kind of massive entertainment being made with such inventiveness and intelligence.
Dune feels so tactile and alive.
"For all its futuristic technology and sandworms, Dune is deeply humanistic, which does not mean it necessarily celebrates humanity, but rather in the sense that Greek tragedies of hubris and self-annihilation are humanistic."
"It's a larger than life film, and though it easily could have rested on spectacle, it manages to have substance in its detailing of tyranny, rebellion, and respecting one's culture."
"If David Lean could make a space picture, Dune would be it."
"Dune is as much an experience as it is a movie - an orgy of immersive visuals, music and sound that pull you into its enthralling world."
Come to theater and you'll live quite deliciously throughout the two and a half hour runtime.
Villeneuve's Dune is a triumphantly cohesive assembly of a very difficult to adapt novel by Frank Herbert.
Dune is easily one of the best visually & audibly crafted films of 2021. Hans Zimmer's score is perfection. Narratively? hmmm not so much.
"Dune: Part One is a stunning piece of work in that context, one that could well be for the ages."
"Nowhere near as enjoyable as Villeneuve's inspired Blade Runner 2049, Dune is an achievement for sure, but watching it is rather like having huge marble monoliths dropped on you for two and a half hours."
"Perhaps it will ultimately work better when seen in it's full context once Part II is released, but Dune as it stands is a curiously weightless affair, all sturm and no drang, a vaguely intriguing setup that is shockingly unsatisfying."
[Dune delivers] visually... and less well in terms of sound. [Full review in Spanish]
"A film that is sweeping in scope, rich with the kind of computer-graphics that we've come to expect and characters that -- for the most part -- feel fully fleshed out."
Constantly captivating and everything from its big moments to its small details feels unique.
An ambitiously stunning piece but for all that comes in between leaves the taste of a bland wet fish.
"This is a sumptuous experience, larger than life yet intimate."
"... funny, gory, energetic, and marvelously absurdist. What else would you expect from 'Guardians of the Galaxy' director James Gunn?"
Imagine Tarantino directed an R-rated version of the live-action Scooby-Doo film with a CGI shark and you get The Suicide Squad.
"EVERYTHING I WANTED & MORE! It’s hilarious, entertaining, surprisingly emotional but brutal/bloody at the same time! James Gunn not just crafted one of my favorite comic book movies once again, he created a flat out Creative WACKY EXPERIENCE"
"The phenomenal cast elevates the overall picture with fantastic performances all-around, though Daniela Melchior's breakthrough performance is an absolute standout. James Gunn just can't seem to miss."
"The material is bonkers enough to let Gunn play with stereotypes, employ fresh visuals, and use this versatile cast to deliver crazy sequences that go overboard on purpose."
"Cascading with carnage, The Suicide Squad is shamelessly silly and savage while tapping into gruesome imagination."
"The Suicide Squad isn’t a subtle film, in its violence, or its themes. There is a lot to unpack with this film regarding the American prison system, American Interventionalism, and what it means to keep the peace."
"If you are looking for a film that improves on every misstep that its predecessors made, The Suicide Squad is that film. You will laugh, you will wince, you will aww, you may even cry, as you are sucked into the magic of a rated-R James Gunn film. "
"Everything I'd hoped it would be: it was funny, shocking, violent — it was everything you'd want in a movie about expendable supervillains, and so unlike anything else we've seen in the genre."
"It isn’t that you don’t believe the people in the film, but that the situations are so outlandish, they could have only originated on the comic page and that alone should be worth the price of admission."
"""There is so little that is new or surprising in this genre, that it takes true innovation to get anywhere close to the inventiness that makes these films truly sing."""
Ferociously funny and devilishly cool. 
"The Suicide Squad is the most fun you’ll have at the movies all summer, as James Gunn serves up a gloriously gory and gut-busting superhero spectacle."
"Even with its flaws, the film has this uniquely raucous and chaotic pulse and once you get in sync with it you can’t help but have a good time."
A bad reheated dish simply prepared to consume before it expires... [Full review in Spanish]
"""I actually really enjoyed the film. I audibly laughed out loud a few times. John Cena is hilarious in this film as Peacemaker, he actually has some of the best one liners of the film."""
"James Gunn not only provides a hilarious and unique superhero tale, but also brings a surprising understand and empathy to those who are often cast as villains in a world that never allows them to be seen as anything else. "
"THE SUICIDE SQUAD sticks to its love for dark-humored, splatter b-movie schlock so much, that it almost becomes a detriment. But the whole thing is just too different and crazy to not somehow endear the film and its strange characters."
"Nothing would prepare me for the high-octane, love letter to the genre that would be James Gunns The Suicide Squad. A film that is more than a blockbuster, its cinema at its grandest and most pleasing."
"It's hard to see Gunn's first DC adventure as anything other than successful. A chaotic joy, The Suicide Squad doesn't have much of a point to make - most superhero films try to build a universe, this one blows it to smithereens."
The Suicide Squad isn't a horrible movie. It's just not a terribly memorable one. 
"With The Suicide Squad, James Gunn blends his earlier sensibilities into a pitch-perfect summation of his work to this point. "
Gunn's smart-aleck supervillain team adventure is a labor of twisted love bursting with genuinely funny sick jokes and sicker characters (Polka-Dot Man shoots out lethal polka dots). 
"The Suicide Squad feels like a rare treat, something to be treasured and something worthy of the big screen experience."
"The Suicide Squad gives James Gunn big-budget carte blanche to deliver his unhinged vision for the titular cabal of anti-heroes, and the result is one of the most thrillingly unrestrained comic book movies ever made."
"Funny when it needs to be, heartfelt when it wants to be, and just gloriously fit for purpose."
"James Gunn's The Suicide Squad represents a considerable improvement over David Ayer's disastrous 2016 film, infusing exciting action, great characters, and lots of humor into a highly entertaining flick."
It feels like the cinematic equivalent of the modern Internet experience.
"Bizarre and more gore, but also much more badass and poetic. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"While this one looks like it could be a kids superhero movie to an extent, don't be fooled: it's rough. It's a niche superhero movie and one for those with adventurous and not so easily offended taste."
"Heads and shoulders above its predecessor, but - like Gunn's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - its quirkiness and shock elements all feel safe and corporate-approved."
"The Suicide Squad is an uproarious extravaganza filled with grotesque nom-noms, full-on naked dick shots, and John Cena in tighty-whities and it's is the most fun you'll have with an R-rated comic book film in a theater since Deadpool."
The merits of bonkers violence and James Gunn's style are easy to find.
"If there's only one true, declarative statement to be made about James Gunn's ""The Suicide Squad,"" it would be that the film is entirely and undoubtedly a product of trust."
"If you're wondering how all of them manage to have a meaningful part that adds substance to Suicide Squad, don't. But adding logic to Suicide Squad is pointless."
You'll be lucky to have this much fun in a cinema again this year.
"It's a hyper-violent, horny, gore spurting, roller coaster ride built around a warmly beating, but battered heart."
"Gunn gets in the zone, but it ends up being too little, too late."
The film refuses to take itself seriously at the same time it manages to avoid the dangerous sanitization of violence thats so common in the genre. [Full review in Portuguese]
"A film can be funny and lively, use its main faces well, have a few nice moments with its supporting cast and improve on its predecessor, and yet still fall into a routine... keep rehashing the same things, and just be average."
"Even when it doesn't work, the fact that it exists is a triumph."
As much a jeering middle finger to the wannabe ratf*ckers who got Gunn fired from Disney as it is a joyous rejection of the so-called SnyderVerse.
Comparing 2016's Suicide Squad to 2021's series reboot is like comparing day-old gas station sushi to three-star Michelin sushi chef Jiro Ono's finest dish.
"Its dark wit and ultraviolence may not be for everyone, but those who dig this tone will have a lot of fun watching and rewatching this crazy, chaotic - and unexpectedly touching - flick."
The film moves fast; it's forgettable and quite enjoyable.
"While the film depicts the murder of a main character as a tragedy, it plays a boomerang slicing an anonymous soldier's head in half as a joke, suggesting that Gunn thinks violence is funny as long as it happens to other people."
"Gunn is blissfully efficient in establishing the familiar rules to ensure it doesn't get bogged down in exposition, unlike the prior entry."
"This is a comic book movie, not an adaptation vaguely embarrassed to be rooted in such source material like Joker or some of DC's more po-faced efforts."
"Spectacle at its best, pathos at its most palpable. Maybe hyperbole, but I don't care. It's great!"
"If the film represents the DCEU finding its own unique voice, consider me impressed."
Including so many characters and so much action and so much gore and so much swearing has only made it feel like a BIG yet somewhat empty film. [Full review in Spanish]
The outrageous avalanche of anarchy and energy is non-stop.
"Certainly an improvement over David Ayer's 2016 original, although that's a fairly low bar to clear."
That's the biggest strength of The Suicide Squad -- embracing the capes-and-tights minutiae of an eight-decade-old medium to prove that the source material barely needs a punch-up to entertain the masses.
This movie kept my attention more than any film I've watched over the past few months. It was fun and engaging to the point where I was entertained from start to finish.
This was a genuine fun movie that had some sad and dark moments but they worked. It's hard to get all of those feels in one movie. Especially a comic book movie.
"The social commentary might be blatant, but the over the top action and CGI-candy still leaves a bigger impression as a superhero movie is expected to these days."
"DC may often play second fiddle to Marvel, but this movie is DCEU done right. It's bloody, funny, and has just enough heart to make the band of merry misfit anti-heroes endearing. Plus, it's just a really, really wicked awesome movie."
"An invigorating blast of bloody, disreputable comic-book cinema, ""The Suicide Squad"" turns its titular criminals into a collection of lovable anti-heroes set loose in a dazzling, surprisingly emotional adventure."
"Gunn's assembled a bundle of messages here through the songs and stories his handiwork contains. In doing so, he's painted an illuminating portrait of who its maker is - but he hasn't crafted the kind of picture he should want to."
"This is one sick, totally fun blast,"
"Stunning, bloody, strange and very entertaining despite all its hokum."
"The Suicide Squad is much better than its predecessor (it was not difficult to improve it). James Gunn's hand is very noticeable, offering us a fun movie with a fantastic soundtrack and blood, lots of blood. [Full review in Spanish]"
The thing that makes The Suicide Squad so singularly distasteful is closely related to its factory-installed cynicism: the unconscionable glibness that grows out of it.
"The Suicide Squad is a magnificent blend of gore, heart, and humor that engages its audience instantly with strong characters, performances, and breathtaking visuals."
I had a great time with this movie.
"It can't stop nudging the audience about how ridiculous all of this is; the opening reel is essentially a series of eye-rolls about the film's own preposterousness, with the audience flattered at being in on the joke."
"Definitely a movie worth watching and enjoying. In so many ways, The Suicide Squad' lives up to its name, but I am starting to see the formulaic nature of superhero movies, which is worrisome."
Imagine if Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool had some horribly beautiful baby.
I've never been so annoyed by a movie in my entire life... way to gimmicky for its own good.
"From the bonkers fight choreography to the macabre logic driving the madcap action, this stylized comic book world looked nothing like ours, and was all the more transporting and entertaining for it."
"...fares much, much better than David Ayer's misbegotten take on the DC Comics creation..."
"Here to have fun, and it succeeds without ever feeling weighed down by true nihilism or any agenda beyond entertaining the hell out of audiences."
James Gunn directed this inventive but only partially successful sequel.
"Gunn understands that the Squad is a group of misfits and he uses their reduced status to make them effective underdogs. More importantly, his screenplay has a beating heart underneath the gore."
"It's arguably the strongest of all the recent DC films so far, and a hopeful sign that the studio has a brighter future ahead."
The Suicide Squad explodes with loopy mix of horror and sick humor.
"Here, everyone just does what they want, and that's really good news for a DC Comics movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Where ""The Suicide Squad"" really succeeds, and separates itself from its predecessor (which was more about America relying on bad people to do our dirty business), is re-framing its characters as victims, not just villains."
"Love the cast dynamic, violent gory kills, humor, soundtrack, and even the heartfelt moments. Only Gunn can make me care about a rat who waves."
"The film's final nemesis is a hoot, but it's also genuinely creepy."
"With its insane action set-pieces, strong performances from its lead cast, and bucket loads of gore, The Suicide Squad could easily be one of the best superhero movies ever made."
"The movie's saving grace lies in its willingness to embrace the ridiculous and, in the process, poke fun at the kind of movie it easily could have been; i.e., one that took itself more more seriously..."
"If billionaires wanna set their money on fire by using computers to animate the 12th Doctor (Peter Capaldi) staring down a several-skyscraper-sized creature named Starro, that is almost certainly less evil than whatever else they were going to do with it."
"If you enjoy cartoonish excess even when it extends to violence then this hard R, DC Comics super anti-hero action film is exactly what you need."
"It's corporate irreverence, which means fundamentally and most urgently it's a safe space for viewers. It's also pretty funny at times."
"The Suicide Squad is fun and funny, though the over-the-top violence won't appeal to everyone."
"The Suicide Squad is brutal, funny and brutally funny, illustrative of the possibilities that develop when comic book cinema doesn't take itself quite so seriously. All in all, it's a hell of a good time."
"Its crazy visuals and violence is complemented by a crazier bunch of characters, a fun story, and more than its fair share of heartwarming moments."
"Better, more entertaining, and cohesive than its predecessor. And if you don't mind the decidedly R-rated material, you might just enjoy this wild and crazy ride."
"There's little question this entire escapade is so much better than the last one, hardly a high bar to hurdle, and I did have a pretty good time."
"Maybe it didn't need to be two hours 12 minutes long but for the most part, The Suicide Squad earns its length."
It's a swell tribute to Gunn's origins as a genre filmmaker while demonstrating his essential skill as both a writer and director of populist blockbusters.
"Full of gleeful gore and carnage, infectiously silly jokes, and an overall vulgar, irreverent attitude, this wily, invigorating DCEU movie also offers surprisingly strong teamwork and lots of heart."
"'The Suicide Squad' represents the very best that DC films can be, taking the kind of risks that you wouldn't see in a Marvel property."
"Sidestepping the silliness of the plot, it's joyous fun throughout; the entire cast is a blast, not least Peter Capaldi's mad-scientist baddie, the Thinker."
"If there was even an iota of human emotion evident the movie would be unbearable as well as increasingly vile. But there isn't, so instead it's just kind of exhausting..."
"Delivers upon its promise as a whacky, gore infused counterpart to the usual DC universe fair."
"There's stuff in this movie that will make you cringe even as you're doubled over with laughter, to be sure, but what makes this the kind of film audiences will keep coming back to is the sense of emotional range woven through the whole thing."
James Gunn's The Suicide Squad puts the DC Comics franchise back on track by playing to everyone's strengths.
A precise dissection of a relationship as its being lived in the heads of these two very flawed and naive characters.
"This is a highly intelligent, finely-acted, astutely-written and directed, well-shot (cinematographer Manuel Billeter) film that will leave questions in your mind well after the credits roll."
"As was the case in print, this spectacularly unsensual encounter is simultaneously provocative, funny, depressing and unfailingly perceptive about shifting power dynamics. "
"The film explores the reasons behind what becomes a pretty catastrophic failure in communication, and it does this with a great deal of humour and even some very well directed sequences that push the film into the realm of psychological thriller. "
…. what is said not only lacks any real bite but is supplemented with wishy-washy backtracking that makes it seem like the filmmakers were scared to make the audience feel confronted… and so made it uncomfortable in a completely different way.
"The climax fatally over-stretches the source material, trading the story's uneasy ambiguities for a noisy mess of horror clichés and ludicrous character choices."
"Not a perfect adaptation, but it still works. "
... This blackly comedic thriller is three-quarters of a great cautionary tale about the perils of modern dating.
"Indeed, it does play out a little too long, but I bought the characters."
A fascinating disaster. 
"The writer Michelle Ashford pads out Roupenian’s story with nightmarish daydream sequences that have seemingly drifted over from a thriller or horror film, spelling out the subtext with stunning literalness."
"The cast, including a wonderful bunch of scene-stealing side players, delivers these ideas with intelligence and wit, leaving us with plenty to think about even after the script attempts to tie up the loose ends."
"Whatever its intentions, the film adaptation of Cat Person is the cinematic equivalent of the loudest person in the room with the least amount to say."
"…writer Michelle Ashford’s adaptation of Kristen Roupenian's sensational 2017 short story expands it in all the wrong directions, creating an irrecoverable imbalance and rendering Margot a complete lunatic"
"Lost in a third act that escalates into a lurid, messily violent generic climax that is both infinitely dumber and far less unsettling than the tense, uneasy courtship that precedes it."
Imagine Nora slamming the door at the end of Ibsen’s A Doll’s House and then returning minutes later with a shotgun to blast Torvald’s head off. It’s not much like that. But it’s just about as silly.
"Ultimately, it’s a movie about narratives, the fun ones and the hurtful ones."
"After a standard break-up, the film moves from a sharp study of the highs and lows of in-person dating to a violent, psychological thriller. Fogel deals with this change of pace well, leaving an air of mystery and wonder around labels we put on people."
Cat Person offers genuine insights into the female experience of dating before collapsing into a bog standard horror.
"[Cat Person] has its moments and boasts a classy performance by Britain's own Emilia Jones... but it's a story of sex and sexual politics that falls over itself trying to be a thriller, and ultimately isn't a particularly plausible one."
"Cat Person is a masterclass in awkwardness and Fogel revels in making her audience squirm, but these elements alone don’t make a great film. The message gets lost halfway through and the entire thing falls down like a house of cards."
"Fogel’s film has derived a certain amount of energy from swinging recklessly between tones, alighting for its most effective moments on the genuine tragicomedy of bad sex. But is this farce now? Horror? Gender thesis? It’s a grab bag."
"Cat Person is an entertaining, thought-provoking, well-made film that should raise Jones’ and Braun’s film acting profiles.

"
Director Susanna Fogel and screenwriter Michelle Ashford handle [the sex] scene wittily and brilliantly. If only the rest of the film were as successful (though Jones and Braun are excellent). 
"It's a conversation starter that makes you squirm in your seat, but it could still make one hell of date movie."
"Adapting a relatively uneventful short story was always going to be tricky, and despite some strong performances and wry observations, Cat Person’s disastrous ending takes everything else down with it."
"Cat Person is horrible material for a film, as Roupenian herself has joked. It’s a claustrophobically psychological story about being stuck in your own head, in which almost nothing happens. Fogel fails to dramatise this."
"Cat Person the film is not a must-see, despite some chewy moments and two poised performances from Emilia Jones and Nicholas Braun."
"[Cat Person] takes what was provocative about the short story and transforms it into a 1980s-style psychological thriller so ineptly constructed that, even though it’s told from the woman’s perspective, it turns Margot into an actual psychopath..."
"Dleverly detailed swatch of a story about miscommunication between a 20-year-old college student and... a 33-year-old man of indeterminate experience... Too much mortification, not enough murder."
"Funny and frightening, this hair-raising cautionary fictional romance is all too realistic. "
"As it probes deeper into paranoia and empowerment, this low-key psychological thriller loses its narrative footing in a muddled and misguided final act."
"Cat Person is well-made, but eventually so melodramatically contrived, it betrays the complicated issues it intends to probe."
"Cat Person is swallowed by its own bloat, if not its very own ill-conceived existence.
"
"The cringe of modern relationships stinks up this antiromance. Its bald truths, all but ignored in pop culture, about how women navigate romantic and sexual relationships with men, demand to be heard."
"It's a carefully low-key film — until the end, when Fogel whips up a sudden storm of action that might have been imported from another movie altogether. "
"As an eighty-minute transformation across artistic mediums, it's actually quite effective. Here’s the issue: CAT PERSON isn't an eighty-minute film. It's two hours long [with a new, tacked-on conclusion]."
[T]he result is a thematic fight that's only slightly less uncomfortable than the literal one in the third act.
"Cat Person is a sharp study of the highs and lows of in-person and online connection, anchored by outstanding performances from Emilia Jones and Nicholas Braun
"
"With all the quirky needle drops substituting for real mood, and the flippant dialogue spelling everything out for us, this “Cat Person” proves as susceptible to misreading the vibe as its crossed-wire characters"
"The movie, naturally, wants to tell us more than a roughly 7,000-word work of short fiction can. But this examination of the personalities and emotions we project onto others forgets to leave some space unfilled."
"The film swerves into the totally unbelievable, pulling from a grab-bag of horror/erotic thriller tropes, all of which beggar belief."
"Fogel and screenwriter Michelle Ashford struggle to effectively externalize the many themes their adaptation keeps gesturing towards, whether that's the landmines women have to navigate while dating or simply the discomfort of ambiguity."
"It’s true that dating in a misogynistic world is a scary prospect, and Fogel and Ashford certainly recognize all the subtle ways that fear can creep in through uncertainty. If only they trusted their audience to do the same."
"Cat Person takes the obnoxiously unsubtle route, ballooning the intimate grey areas of the original viral story into inane, cut-and-dry moments."
Cat Person is an honest depiction of female discomfort in the modern world of dating that will spark further discussion around gray areas and consent and even hit too close to home for my own dating experiences. 
Cat Person is about to become a huge hit for many people! A film that carefully stresses you out as it examines the fear of modern dating for women. I can see many relating to the cringe & uncomfortable moments. Talk about the nightmare of dating movies
"Cat Person is poised to become a lightning rod for discussions surrounding the intricacies of dating and the difficulties of being a woman, a man, or simply someone seeking love"
"Takes a thoughtful, interesting, and cautionary tale about the perils of modern dating and tacks on an icky third act that results in a massive misfire. "
"Although the film significantly drags in the middle, the third act will knock you out as Jones and Braun’s performances stick with you post-viewing."
"While Emilia Jones and Nicholas Braun bring their considerable charms to a delightfully off-kilter couple, the fact that ""Cat Person"" continually insists upon veering into left field makes it kind of a mess."
"In spite of not finding enjoyment in my viewing experience of Cat Person, it still is a movie that I recommend everyone watch… if it ever finds distribution. "
The high-wired final act pushes Cat Person into full suspense-thriller territory with mixed results.
"Powerful, provocative, and libel to promote debate - Cat Person is a film with plenty to say. Directed by Susanna Fogel and adapted from the short story by Kristen Roupenian, this features Emilia Jones and Nicholas Braun in a hard hitting tale."
"A film that has little to offer or imagine in the way of an insightful exploration of the lives of Gen Z women, starting with the decision to turn a quiet, introspective piece on modern miscommunication into a thriller."
"It moves from figurative to literal, in a way that actually reduces the tension, letting the audience off the hook, essentially, and dulling its resonance."
The central portion of the film is delciously discomfiting.
The performance by Jones supports how vulnerable a woman might feel on a first date with a stranger.
"Is the film good? I have no idea. It does something arguably even more important, as my laughing and cringing can attest to: It pins down the very idea of emotional ambiguity."
"This added-on chapter really doesn't work, but it's an interesting swing that's fun to think and talk about even if it goes off the deep end. Cat"
"In these trying times, we need to be able to make fun of men who are flops."
Cat Person reads like a dating columnist’s advice to lonely hearts warning of dating perils .. narrative is engrossing and effective for the first two parts of the film but tapers out .. Cat Person is akin to a sweet and sour dish catering to most tastes 
"Jones and Braun kept me in the film to the end so that I was never bored, even if I kept thinking about how the movie around them doesn't quite live up to what they're delivering."
"The film ponders potent notions about perception via the male vs. female perspective, and, frighteningly, as in ""Fair Play,"" highlights just how dangerous men can become when their egos are bruised."
"It’s 80ish minutes of a clever “nowadays” dating satire flanked by one of the most self-defeating third acts I’ve seen in a long, long time."
The shame is that “Cat Person” buys into gender clichés with that appalling ending and warps a unique interpersonal experience into something so average it’s actually boring. 
"If I had seen this film at 20, it would have made me feel less alone.  Even in my 50's, it gets to my core.  The filmmakers marvelously recreated the all too real experience of a young woman trying to be open to a man, while also keeping herself safe."
"Rarely has a film better-immersed viewers in this mindset of the modern woman, illustrated here quite explicitly with the presence of two Margots (Jones) at times, bickering back and forth with how to respond and react to suspicious situations."
"Sometimes things exist in the right medium the first time, Cat Person is certainly one such case."
Cat Person belongs in the litter box.
"Tonally confused, Cat Person doesn’t quite stick the landing as a cautionary tale on the perils of modern dating."
"The film excels at presenting both sides of the dating spectrum and tacitly flips the script numerous times, subverting expectations and keeping audiences on the edge of their seats. It’s unpredictable. "
"Roupenian’s story collection was naturally overshadowed by its most famous piece, but now she achieves the truest form of literary canonization: Her good fiction has been turned into a bad movie."
There are some jarring inconsistencies with the film: Is it a horror? Is it a comedy? What even is it anyway? Why do we have to sit through two hours of watching her try to date this painfully dumb guy?
"At times it feels like a traditional rom-com, at others a psychological horror when we see Margot’s constant fear of death being visualized, and eventually a terrifying confrontation puts you on the edge of your seat."
A cautionary tale about how women must dance around the emotional landmines littering fragile male egos. 
"We’ve all had dating stories that fizzle out, but 'Cat Person' forcefully commits to an idea so firmly that this dynamic's clever, ambiguous nature gets drained out."
"Sure to prompt many bad-date memories and post-screening debates, Cat Person adroitly balances goofy and scary, with possibly the worst screen kiss ever."
"Cat Person is more grating than thrilling, biting off far more than it can chew narratively and thematically. "
"An adaptation of the short story that resolutely ignores that complicating follow-up essay, toggling between overt comedy and horror."
A tame yet enjoyable triumph for fans of the video game. Those unfamiliar with the series might walk away feeling more lost than a devoted fan.
"You’d be forgiven for expecting a zany, over-the-top romp in which heroes battle the increasingly creepy cartoon animal-like robots as they fight to stay alive, but it isn’t that. Well, OK, it’s … kinda that … eventually."
All this movie needs is Nic Cage and it'd be fine. 
"A deeply unpleasant and quite ridiculous game of hopscotch among devastating kidnapping thriller, nasty family drama, and empty serial killer nonsense."
The film mostly concentrates on Mike’s familial travails and history. It flails around trying to come up with psychologically resonant characteristics for its protagonist. It ends up with an inert and implausible narrative.
" Intended (apparently) as a horror flick, it’s not scary, and, despite the absurdity of the story, it’s not funny. It’s barely anything at all."
"A lot of it feels like an Elm Street sequel, and you’ve got to respect a film about menacing animatronics that casts Mary Stuart Masterson."
"An early sequence where we watch these mascots come to life and dispatch a group of people shows promise for something better (and the animatronics do look pretty solid), but it’s all for naught. This is about as good as cardboard pizza."
"A video game adaptation made overtly for the fans and only the fans.  Newcomers will be totally lost, but it's target audience should have fun."
So much plot is crammed into this nearly 2-hour film that it's honestly quite shocking that there's nary a scare to be found.
"Convoluted subplots risk derailing the narrative on more than one occasion, but Freddy and his menacing cohorts, created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, do just about enough to deliver some fun and frights."
"Seriously, how do you mess up a setup as foolproof as this one?"
"One of the most forgettable, half-a---d horror movies of the past few years. Five Nights at Freddy's isn't just an ambitious failure; it's a film that treads the water of familiar cliches for an hour and a half and then fizzles out."
The film struggles to balance its disparate tones and subject matter (fun animatronics with child murder) while barely containing enough scares and violence to act as a gateway horror flick for pre-teens. At least Matthew Lillard is having fun.
The problem could hinge on the film’s rating. An R might have opened the door to more malevolence. A PG-13 simply makes the lights flicker.
"As a review, I enjoyed it for what it was, though hardcore fans seem to see Easter eggs left and right. So I'll give it a B- as a midground."
The FNAF movie will likely work better for hardcore fans than it will for newcomers. The evil Chuck E Cheese aesthetic is effectively fun and the animatronics look great. The main character's story and the Fazbear Pizzeria fail to connect fully. 
"With humor and a few minor bloody scenes plus the ghost children element, Five Nights at Freddy’s falls somewhere between R. L. Stine’s Goosebumps and Gremlins. It’s creepy fun for kids and adults, however, young children may find a few scenes frightening"
"Five Nights at Freddy’s offers some fun thrills and manages to bring the animatronics to life, but unfortunately the same can’t be said for its human characters."
"Maybe the fans are satiated by reams of lore, but we wanted blood. Even if it was a bit of a gory romp, that wouldn't do much to paper over the technical cracks, like some of its shoddy editing. Josh Hutcherson innocent, of course."
"It delivers creepy animatronics and excellent visual effects; unfortunately, almost everything else falls flat. The story is unnecessarily convoluted with awkward dialogue, and the impressive slasher sequences are few and far in-between."
"The film expands the lore of the simple game it's based on, allowing it to go beyond jump scares and cheap thrills. It starts off slow but builds into a satisfying mystery. "
"I wish Five Nights at Freddy’s was wackier, bloodier, and actually scary."
A lot better than what was expected but let's face it it was the actors in this film that saved it.
A movie made for gamers and not the general audience.
"Lulls settle in when Mike’s backstory is belabored or when a cop shows up repeatedly just to drop exposition, but the film should serve as a macabre-cute gateway horror picture for younger audiences and fans of the franchise."
"... A succession of repetitive scenes replete with bland characters (with the notable exception of William Afton, wonderfully played by Matthew Lillard) that explore '80s iconography retrofitted for the new millennium. [Full review in Spanish]"
"This adaptation of a popular 2014 video game has some elements that really work well, but ultimately the latest entry to the horror genre falls short in large part to an uneven tone that can’t exactly decide how dark it truly wants to be."
"[S]ame-day theater and streaming release dates, wicked puppetry, and the Matthew Lillard return to horror. In those regards, this movie did deliver. I choose to save those three things from this burning building as I watch the rest go up in flames."
"Five Nights at Freddy's is a decent entry-level horror flick and the animatronics look fantastic, but it's story is an overstuffed mess that tries to pack in too much lore at once."
"This is a flawed motion picture, but it offers families the chance to be scared together, and when it works, it is both creepy and fun."
"So little makes sense in this utterly predictable film, that it makes even the few and far between legit scare sequences not worth it"
Director Emma Tammi wants the viewer to spend Five Nights at Freddy’s. But it is essentially one night too many. 
"With a cast of one, a single setting, and minimal dialogue, the game did much better storytelling than its overloaded failed-trope adaptation."
Will probably become a cult classic. [Full review in Spanish]
"Overall, the film needed more of the tension the video game series is known for, not to mention their arcade-fun terror, but it still serves as a solid Five Nights at Freddy’s franchise opener."
An intriguing premise undermined by simply terrible storytelling...
Five Nights at Freddy’s might play better for video game enthusiasts who know this world already. Newcomers might not find the edge they were hoping for.
"The pacing is bad, the plotting is both convoluted and also somehow weirdly shallow, the writing is laughable, and the action is simplistic. I would not recommend seeing Five Nights at Freddy’s, as it is not good."
"Five Nights at Freddy's could have used a couple more evenings working on the screenplay. Turgid, muddled, and lacking atmosphere, five minutes with Fazbear would have sufficed. One of the worst movies of 2023."
"There are some pacing issues, and the acting could be more balanced. Keeping the majority of the anxiety inducing chills from the video game franchise it stems from, Five Nights at Freddy’s delivers a solid movie experience."
" What director Emma Tammi understood was fans of this property dont just want the scares, but the lore as well, which invests you in these weird characters and their fates and brings us back again and again. "
"A so so adaptation that's entertaining enough, but a must-see for the expertly crafted animatronics. "
"Even if Five Nights at Freddy's somewhat ignores the beginning of the game, the film has its charm.  [Full review in Spanish] "
"Five Nights at Freddy's has a fun and creepy premise, but ultimately is a little too methodical and slowly paced to deliver true thrills."
A story that will delight both fans of the original video games (FNAF) and newcomers alike. [Full review in Spanish] 
Five Nights at Freddy’s is just another poor video game adaptation for the garbage pile.
"The film unsuccessfully tries to merge two disparate tones with an uninteresting and often nonsensical plot. Opportunities for animatronic chaos and excitement are mostly left on the table, resulting in an overall dull affair."
"It's all very tedious when it's not confusing, and it can't even count on atmosphere to salvage it."
"The movie will make you want to quit movies about video games, and perhaps video games as well. "
"A rushed second half, struggling to explain certain character's storylines fails to make the film thrilling or fun. I would say watch ""Child's Play"" or ""MEGAN"" if you want to see a silly, but clever horror about products that shouldn't be coming to life."
...a milquetoast viewing experience...unable to determine just what kind of movie (this) truly wants this to be.
Video game adaptation teeters between serious horror and bloodless camp.
Casual moviegoers may enjoy the dynamic between Mike and Abby but shouldn’t expect much from the disjointed screenplay beyond the odd jump scare and perhaps some chuckles.
"Five Nights at Freddy’s is a hodgepodge of a horror movie. The script and direction throw nearly the kitchen sink at the audience, but nothing feels fully fleshed out. "
"Fans of the video game of the same name will know what’s possible in this spin-off movie, but anyone approaching it as just another horror film might be confounded. "
[Five Nights at Freddy's] is a nice supernatural story that captures the sensations of Goosebumps and the '90s The Midnight Club for a multi-format generation that does not understand entertainment as a static window. [Full review in Spanish]
"With its mix of not-scary-enough horror and too-extensive backstory, this ends up feeling more like franchise maintenance than entertainment. It's a film that exists to further the brand rather than be enjoyable in its own right"
"While it is simply wrong to pass Five Nights at Freddy's off as being another lazy horror adaptation, the film is clearly a monstrous mess."
"Instead of catering to the in-built audience ready and waiting, ""Five Nights"" wastes time trying to win over people who couldn’t care less. As a result, what should’ve been an intricate, twisted, and absurd treat is demoted to generic horror movie sludge."
"It strains to erect a supernatural universe while neglecting to fulfill the basic promises of a scary film built on a gag premise, stretching its dreary tale of trauma to nearly two hours."
"""Five Nights at Freddy’s"" is a decent flick that provides entertainment and scares for younger and older generations. Is it without flaws in its story? No, but this supernatural horror is still fun to see. "
I'm not sure why this movie was even made. The plot was all over the place and was overly predictable. I couldn't tell if I should laugh with it or at it. 
Five Nights at Freddy's is a good adaptation of the video game of the same name that manages to keep the viewer tense throughout the entire show thanks to its creepy atmosphere and impressive special effects. [Full review in Spanish] 
"If we ignore that this is supposed to be a horror film... on its own merit, the film is fun to watch. From start to finish we are taken on a journey that has emotional depth and connects us to the main characters."
"It’s an uneven scarefest, but the bloodthirst is at least refreshing."
"Though it may not be the film we asked for this Halloween weekend, it's refreshing to see Josh Hutcherson in a starring role again in this quirky horror fairytale. "
"As it is, the movie seems best suited for those who prefer their scares within boundaries, and aren’t too concerned with plot logic."
Emma Tammi has done the unexpected. She made a tasty meal out of pre-packaged pizza dough when most folks were expecting Chuck E. Cheese-level quality. 
"Five Nights at Freddy's is awful. They didn't have anything for two hours, much less five nights."
"The seesaw definitely tips toward fan service, though there are some horror pleasures that anyone can appreciate."
"A horror film doesn’t have to be R rated to be good, but Five Nights at Freddy’s feels like 30 minutes of interesting ideas padded out to almost two hours"
"Based on the popular horror video games, this movie starts out well, with sympathetic characters, a fun design, and an appealing comical tone, but it goes on too long and eventually falls apart."
"It isn’t perfect, far from it, but try to tell that to the kids who love FNAF and they will have thousands of reasons why you are wrong. "
"Five Nights at Freddy's is a yawn and a half ... Sorry, Freddy. Back to the stage for you."
"Five Nights at Freddy's forgets to be fun or scary, limiting what genre effectiveness can be mustered up here."
Not fun enough. Not scary enough. It just exists.
Newcomers will appreciate that a PG-13 rated film isn’t afraid to kill kids and shred unwitting trespassers. Genre and game fans will howl with appreciation at the Easter eggs embedded throughout. 
Five Nights at Freddy’s was overall a bit too long but pretty much an okay movie for the season and did right by its source material.
"Almost worth a recommendation, but when a film about animatronics killing has very little animatronics killing, many won't get their money's worth. "
"The plot is as dingy and full of holes as a 10-year-old pair of underpants, and about as much fun to watch."
"For something that features an enormous robot chicken armed with a cupcake, [it's] an oddly serious, even dour movie."
Five Nights at Freddy’s commits the worst crime of all – it’s dull from beginning to end. It’s a frustrating miss on a premise and franchise that can be so much more.
"Hutcherson is admirably committed to the film-makers’ apparent desire to make something miserable of a scenario that, as one Oscar-winning actor has shown, is more accommodating of psychedelic comedy."
"[A] fun gateway horror film ... has [plot] holes bigger than a pizzeria ... but it’s a film where those of a certain age will jump and shriek at the right places, then laugh over how they survived."
"...a classic case of getting so carried away with other things that you shortchange what people are coming to see. More specifically, it gets bogged down in bland uninteresting drama rather than delivering the wacky animatronic horror it advertises."
"Five Nights At Freddy’s saving grace for it is that it’s immediately available on Peacock. While it may not live up to the ambition of the project or the IP, it is perfect for the Halloween season."
"Sloppy, boring and unscary, Five Nights at Freddy's is a big letdown. [Full review in Spanish]"
"I hate singling out actors because bad movies are rarely their fault, but Hutcherson’s terrible performance is right at home in this stuffed dog of a thriller."
"Emma Tammi’s horror-mystery film isn’t perfect, but it’s compelling and scary enough to beg for sequels."
"Franchise devotees will find a little more traction here via inside-baseball references... Beyond that, the movie commits the indefensible crime of being no fun whatsoever."
"... A movie that is somewhat schematic in its development, superficial, and remains halfway throughout. [Full review in Spanish]"
It’s a fun gateway horror movie for kids—and the easily scared who want to test their limits lightly.
"This is gateway horror, and it’s pretty damn fun gateway horror at that. But the “PG-13 horror is inherently evil” crowd will no doubt walk away deeply disappointed. A solid effort that underdelivers in some areas but exceeds expectations in others.  "
I was more bored than scared.
"It has a great look and feels true to the game, but it is a bit overwritten to add a story to otherwise mundane game play."
"Josh Hutcherson is good as Mike but aside from that, viewers will be longing to see “Game Over” flash on cinema screens."
"Though deadly robots and spooky kids would each be frightening enough alone without them teaming up, somehow, when they’re together here, they’re not that scary or much fun."
"This movie is absolutely terrible. It is slow, it is not scary, it is not funny. It's just not a well done movie. "
"Like Teletubbies with chainsaws, or knife-wielding Fimbles, it’s absurd. But not in a good way."
The Hunger Games is insipid. [Full review in Spanish]
"I confess that for all my issues with the film (and there are many), I more impressed at how much it got right."
"The first film in this franchise is really fun. Yes, it is long, but with the smaller budget the filmmaking is really strong and the emotional beats do work."
"Whatever objections one might have about the execution, it’s a compelling story that’s been made into a serviceable film."
It’s a dystopian science fiction film that’s based on a preposterous premise yet it manages to be strikingly entertaining.
The Hunger Games is every bit as thrilling as its source material even if it does make some changes from the book.
[Rue's] presence gave the heart to the whole movie.
"The world and the situation in which Katniss finds herself are ripe with possibilities for deeper commentary, but so many of those possibilities are dissipated as the reader or viewer becomes swept up in the steady piling up of corpses."
"Despite its intriguing, albeit recycled plotline, several plaguing elements eat away at the intensity and - perhaps more importantly - the believability."
"The Hunger Games isn't a masterpiece, but it is far better than what most likely expected from the film."
"'The Hunger Games' is a fantasy spectacle that energetically takes over your eyes and leaves you hungry for more ""games"" and its strange dystopian future.. [Full review in Spanish]"
It doesn't leave any room for virtuosity and is about as literal and unsurprising a visual realisation of the story as you can get.
"Although the casting of a relative unknown like Jennifer Lawrence in the crucial role of Katniss was a bit controversial, in the hindsight of her Oscar win and status as hottest young thing in Hollywood, the choice seems brilliant."
"THE HUNGER GAMES has made its mark and, despite its issues, is a more interesting and admirable one than the 12A audience has been offered in some time."
"It's a bit of a thrill to see a bow-hunting girl nursing and defending her man, a good enough takeaway on its own to recommend The Hunger Games to both kids and the parents who drive them to the movies."
"Jennifer Lawrence is engaging as Katniss; indifferent to the circumstances and determined to survive, you end up admiring her spunk and defiance to The Man."
"Are you hungry yet? I hope so because with The Hunger Games you are in for a seven course meal with all the trimmings, guaranteed to satisfy even the most ravenous fan."
"At its best The Hunger Games is a taut thriller, an edge-of-your-seat ride once the actual games begin."
"Jennifer Lawrence is superb, with an unflinching gaze that's like a powerful alloy of fear and defiance."
"A beautiful, deeply affecting, and riveting film with a heroine for the ages."
The odds are in its favor to please its hard-core devotees and newcomers alike.
"The Hunger Games is undeniably progressive in making its protagonist so plucky, independent, and self-actualizing a young woman."
"The Hunger Games is good, moves adroitly and holds our attention. It just doesn't fire the imagination the way its source material seems to have done for many readers."
Lawrence is superb in her role.
What the film offers that the book does not are elements of the outside world that readers were not privy to when confined to Katniss' head.
The Hunger Games isn't a masterpiece. But it's finally given us a thoughtful action picture for the young and old alike.
"The Hunger Games is impressively cast, beautifully styled, dynamically shot and powerfully edited. However, the standout feature of the film has to be its all encompassing success as an adaptation."
"Ross' film has a defined universe of its own, populated with genuinely emotive, living characters and a tangible sense of despair and decay."
"It takes a while to get off the ground as they are setting up the story for the entire trilogy, but other than that, this movie is a well-acted, visually stunning film."
"Just to show you how dim Gary Ross is, he seems to think he had an ""idea"" about how to portray the poor oppressed people of District 12. He has them all dressed up like 1930s characters. Yup. That's his idea."
"It's as thrilling, captivating and immediate as the book, while streamlining the narrative and cast to fit the conventions of cinema."
"An edible product, but it leaves the spectator in need of a more satisfying meal."
"Extravagant special effects are passed over to give the captivating characters the audience's full attention. Even the picture is often drained of colour, ensuring focus is placed on the people rather than the spectacle."
"This is explicitly not a film about young love, or being torn between boyfriends...It's about being brave, and being alone, and having to grow up too soon."
It's too derivative to feel really special... but it approached some of the material boldly enough to at least feel like an interesting view of familiar ground.
"We've been telling this story for a while now in different forms and modes. . .But The Hunger Games, the books and now the film, have inspired a frenzy in the pre-teen set. I'm not exactly sure why."
"It adds up to an intelligent, reasonably well-made first installment that leaves us primed for Katniss' future adventures."
"A refreshingly gritty and adventurous affair that packs plenty of thematic depth, it doesn't let the ambitious source material down."
"Has all the technical ingredients of a great (and even important) film, but sideswipes them in order to leave the audience feeling like that they have been abandoned in the wilderness of extreme cruelty."
"Though not at all innovative or original, is at least a worthwhile action fantasy."
Director Gary Ross does a great job in bringing the thrilling novel to life in this uncompromising drama.
"The movie is oddly blithe about its central premise. How can this movie set up this monstrous society and this brutal game of genocide and expect us to not only cheer for someone to ""win,"" but also hope she finds someone to kiss in the end?"
The film shows precious little hunger and no sense of game.
"Lawrence makes Katniss a heroine every bit as strong, fearless and compelling as the patron saint of badass females, Lisbeth Salander."
"The filmmakers' devotion to Collins' page-turner will please the book's fans and anyone who likes action, sci-fi, social commentary or a female protagonist with smarts, compassion and survival skills."
An exhilarating debut from the bestselling series about teenagers engaged in a deadly bloodsport.
"Given the recent failure of so many big-budget films, the odds weren't in The Hunger Games favor, either. Thankfully, Hollywood got this one right."
"The supporting cast is excellent (most notably Stanley Tucci as flamboyant television host Caesar Flickerman, and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy, Katniss and Peeta's troubled mentor)."
Some plot threads are underserved but The Hunger Games is a fascinating and disturbing character drama that successfully captures the core themes of the book.
"Sure this entry is a ripoff of ""Battle Royale,"" but it's still an entertaining ride with great casting that will more than likely please fans of the book and those who've never even heard of it."
"Despite a few minor problems, The Hunger Games proves to be a promising start to what will no doubt become the next beloved Hollywood mega-series."
"While the 12A rating renders any serious violence a tad impotent, there is much more going on here than the fawning and frowning of its soppy vampire peer."
A retread of a tale that's The Running Man meets Lord of the Flies with a dash of Twilight for tween-adoring measure.
"I never thought I'd describe a film by Pleasantville and Seabiscuit director Gary Ross as 'whackadoodle,' but if the shoe fits."
"The Hunger Games may be a flawed beast, to be sure, but there's plenty of subtext to glean from the narrative, and a slew of wonderfully rich characters worth investing in."
"While a great ride of a movie, it is also one wrapped around an oddly disquieting message."
The first genuine can't miss film of the year that you'll want to go back to the theater to see over and over again.
"Katniss embodies all that's better than her Hunger Games opponents, being aptly appalled at what she sees while also learning to manipulate her audience."
"""The Hunger Games"" stomps the ""Twilight"" saga flat, and though I found those films somewhat amusing, this one is the real deal..."
... Does a more-than-adequate job of introducing a future world and characters I won't mind revisiting. And it gives you a little to think about while you're waiting.
"A blockbuster that has something to say about the world we could be living in. Unlike Twilight, this film actually has a deeper and more important philosophical meaning."
The phenomenal cast with great chemistry and sincere authentic performances from the older actors empowers the material.
Here's the movie for which millions of fans have been starving.
If 'The Hunger Games' represents the latest book-turned-film blockbuster franchise built on the backs of fanatical adolescents then this is progress indeed.
"[Ross'] version of The Hunger Games, while not perfect, is probably as magnificent I ever my wildest dreams could have hoped for it to be."
"For those unacquainted with the novel, it's a narratively unsatisfying - not to mention visually static - affair, regardless of how much Jennifer Lawrence holds her own."
"What works on the page may not translate to the screen. That's always been the challenge of bringing a writer's vision to the movies. It all comes back to ""suspension of disbelief."""
"Whatever rough patches and shortcomings this first film has, that by the end I was indeed interested in seeing what happens next speaks to how Ross got it mostly right."
"If you've never read Collins' novels, the odds that you'll enjoy the film are not in your favor."
This movie rules.
"If the setup behind 'The Hunger Games' upsets you, that's a good thing."
"Lawrence is a strong role model for young girls with her character's sacrifice, courage, moral grounding in a world that's lost its own, and will to fight for what's right, even if it means sacrificing her own life or sparking a revolution."
"I didn't read the book. While the film is entertaining enough, I never felt drawn in to this new world."
"An entertaining adventure, but while director Gary Ross gets terrific performances from Tucci, Banks, Harrelson, and Lawrence, he drags it out far longer than the story requires."
"Lawrence is terrific in the lead role and gives us someone to root for to survive this horrible ordeal. The supporting players carve out memorable characters. The musical score, costumes and makeup are the other strengths."
I found the sardonic satire of the movie's first half in the Capitol (a city that suggests a meeting of L. Frank Baum and Albert Speer) more intriguing than the insufficiently suspenseful depiction of the Hunger Games competition itself...
"Lawrence proved her ability to carry a character's heavy burden in Winter's Bone. As Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl who is both physically and morally strong, she has gravitas, rarely breaking into a smile, but reveals no sign of self-seriousness."
"Smarter and tougher than Twilight - and with a heroine who couldn't be further removed from drooping, love-struck Bella Swann."
"Solid enough, but for a non-fan fairly unremarkable."
"A cheap looking, drab film."
A triumph of restraint - but had the film been more visceral and less sanitised it might have better implicated viewers in the voyeuristic bloodlust of its entertainment.
"It is better than any of the Twilight movies, which isn't saying much, but it isn't bad. It is just barely O.K. and it badly needed more Steadicams."
The battle that informs this adaptation is between the filmmakers' intent to create a moneymaking franchise... and the efforts of star Jennifer Lawrence to create a compelling movie.
"It has the slightly grubby, cobbled-together look of a futuristic flick from the '70s, but that is part of its charm."
"Jennifer Lawrence brings to the pulpy material a sense of weight and gravity that few young actresses could muster; she has a flinty strength that enhances, rather than belies, her soft features, and it makes Katniss a completely believable protagonist."
"The movie on its own terms is an entirely likable thriller, if a bit light on intelligence and personality."
Jennifer Lawrence's shining talent makes it all come together.
The film is aided immeasurably by Judianna Makovsky's costume design. Clothes are an intentional method of deciphering The Hunger Games' politics.
"This tension-filled action-adventure delivers a pulse-pounding, pop culture message of female empowerment."
The Hunger Games is much more than a game. It is a memorable human experience. Thank the gods for the wonder of literature and the vision of movies. Some of us still hunger for eloquence on the screen.
"Comparisons have been made to Battle Royale - and they're not entirely undeserved - but this is a different film, and never feels like a watered down version of anything else."
"Even when two people are just talking calmly, Ross jerks the camera around. Why? As the sense of danger increases, he has nothing to build toward."
As if it were a survival reality TV show with a real pulse.
"Finally we have a female lead character who is strong without being brutal, appealing without being objectified, and confident without being female-chauvinistic."
"While the ending is a bit of a mess, the rest isn't terrible (and nobody sparkles in the sunlight)."
"Gary Ross' first foray into action filmmaking is occasionally hampered by wobbly camera-work, but is successful in the way it communicates the horror of violence without threatening the teen-friendly rating."
"For those who have not read the book, this film is a movie without a cause."
"Lawrence lends Katniss the kind of gravitas that, initially at least, makes the film's bleak vision of the future seem credible."
Does it really matter that this is not an entirely new idea? Nope.
It's far too long and much inferior to the ferocious Japanese Battle Royale.
A solid new entry with plenty of astonishing set-pieces. 
"Dead Reckoning delivers most of everything that series fans could want, though it’s still only half a film."
"""Dead Reckoning Part One"" is honestly only as great as it is thanks to each film that came before it. So wherever this film may fall on a series ranking list, it owes all of its successes to the work done previously."
"It may not have the strongest storyline of the lot, but it serves it well enough, giving you all the thrills we've come to expect from the series."
The movie delivers an extraordinary production that has a few minutes worthy of the action movie hall of fame... [Full review in Spanish]
"Overlong if enjoyably bonkers, there's also an undercurrent of chaos, with bits of key turning up everywhere; at times it felt like there were enough for everyone to have a spare set. "
"It adheres to a winning formula with Cruise as the virtuous, self-sacrificing meta-daredevil surrounded by whipsmart enablers, charismatic almost-allies, and colorful chaosmongers..."
The film can be enjoyed as irrefutable proof of what can be done with this type of proposal when placed in the right hands.  [Full review in Spanish]
"Cruise's motorcycle stunt is exciting exactly the way thrillers should be exciting. You know that you’re watching a movie, but also you forget that you’re watching a movie."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is an unforgettable cinematic experience that will leave you breathless. This is why we go to the movies.
"McQuarrie and Cruise seem very aware that their storytelling beats are a metaphor for moviemaking: meticulously prepare and plan, vamp wildly when something goes wrong, and brazen it out before the fade to black."
"Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 is the summer blockbuster you’ve been waiting on. Once again, Cruise delivers a great cast to real locations, amid beautifully crafted action sets. "
"The only impossible mission is keeping Tom Cruise away from this spy franchise, and quite frankly, that’s not a bad thing."
"It takes off ... at a full-tilt run, a nimble, entertaining thriller that zings along thanks to crackerjack action sequences and the chemistry of its cast."
"Meeting the canons of the saga while taking the form of an artful spectacle, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One was the most expensive and longest film of the series, but is far from being an extraordinary achievement."
"""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a fine excuse to sit in an air conditioned movie theater for a few hours in the midst of summer, but it's not as good as any of the franchise's predecessors.

"For all its efforts to topple Bond by mirroring/homaging the stunts that came out some 40 years ago, Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One ultimately is but a shadow of something much more interesting and worthy of a Friday night viewing."
A non-stop thrill ride.
"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One starts at top speed and just keeps pressing to go harder, faster and more dangerous."
"There are some great villains, co-conspirators, strange bedfellows and events that will keep you guessing. By the end of the movie I was literally on the edge of my seat wondering who would still be standing and make it to part two. "
Tom Cruise understands better than anyone how to make a great action movie. Dead Reckoning Part One is the perfect summer action movie. 
"Cruise is fine as the ever-cool, superhuman Hunt, but the supporting cast gives the film its oomph. Hayley Atwell stands out, sexy and charismatic as Hunt’s new romantic interest, Grace, a thief.
"
Tom Cruise has one heck of a screen presence and he truly puts his all into the picture.
It is incontrovertible evidence that star/produce Tom Cruise understands the job description of an action star.
Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie continue to push the boundaries of daredevil blockbuster filmmaking.
"Some of the writing in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - DEAD RECKONING PART ONE leaves a little to be desired, but its sense of tone and its action is really great. "
That doesn't mean the race to shut [The Entity] down (or control it) wasn't sufficiently exhilarating or entertaining. It simply felt like an inferior copy [to PERSON OF INTEREST].
"Dead Reckoning continues the Mission: Impossible hot streak of big stunts, thrilling action, and a well-told spy narrative. The AI angle brought a nice change of pace and Hayley Atwell's new character is a standout. "
This is a Tom Cruise film. He knows what the fans want and gives it to them.
"It’s as smart as you need it to be: You can analyze and dissect it for meaning and relevance, or you can just sit back, gobble down popcorn, and let this franchise spectacle blow your mind."
We get a 20-minute sequence where he is trying to convince this lady to put the key back...I thought that was perfectly paced.
"A 163-minute runtime rarely feels this light, thanks to the contributions of the sublime cast - Hayley Atwell is outstanding - and the truly memorable score that elevates all the otherworldly set pieces."
This is going to meet all of the expectations. 
"What makes ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" compelling is its stranglehold over beautifully shot action scenes complimenting an otherwise convoluted premise surrounding artificial intelligence. "
"Like the last several ""Mission: Impossible"" films, this one proves to be an exceptionally competent action-thriller full of beautiful set pieces and spectacular stunts from Cruise himself."
"Tom Cruise and Chris McQuarrie just have the visual language for these films perfected by now, as you can tell they both feel fierce devotion to pushing every single limit for what stunts won’t get Cruise in trouble if he attempts them."
"MI7 once again shows up the rest of this year's big CGI-heavy action blockbusters (again, except John Wick 4) on almost every level, and it often does so through very similar set pieces."
"Tom Cruise continues to deliver a sequel that is equal, if not better, than the last. "
"Dead Reckoning is as advertised. A bombastic summer blockbuster that will put butts in seats, but will likely be forgotten before Dead Reckoning Part Two reaches theatres."
"This has been a remarkably consistent series in terms of quality, with only that dopey Mission: Impossible II preventing a perfect record."
"Cruise commands this exhilarating espionage thriller in full force. Its colossal action sequences and stunts are breathtaking, while its debate around the autonomy of machines is timely. [Full Review in Spanish]"
...a consistently watchable blockbuster that fares better than the majority of similarly-themed contemporary releases...
[A] testosterone soap opera ... If you can let your inhibitions go out the moving train then Dead Reckoning Part One will delight. 
The kind of movie spectacle that always looks best on the biggest and brightest of silver screens.
"Like a motorcycle leaping off a mountain, this movie has very high highs and very low lows... But as soon as the action started, especially the last action set pieces, I could've rolled right into the sequel immediately."
"While Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, Part One is exceptional for action movie standards, it’s frustratingly middling for Mission: Impossible standards. "
"The familiarity is part of the game, of course: Introducing enough new stunts and beautiful faces to wow the crowds while taking ownership over the iconography to keep others from snatching it away."
"The stunts are enough to make it a good time… They’re not enough to make it a great movie, or even a great Mission: Impossible movie. Like its AI villain, Reckoning may have become too self aware."
"Doesn’t quite hit the same levels as Rogue Nation and Fallout. However, it still delivers an incredible action-packed film with compelling characters that manage to bring both moments of extreme tension and laughs."
"There is very little doubt that Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 is a very impressive film, but the good news is it a combination of some smart script writing, impressive stunts and great acting that makes it that way. "
"Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One is EXHILARATING. It’s impossible to fathom how this cast and crew manage to create these edge of your seat action set pieces that some how one up each other. This felt the closest to Brian De Palma 96 Mission.
"
"With another strong outing, The Mission: Impossible series proves that it represents the pinnacle of blockbuster filmmaking.
"
"""A real reversal of what we might consider socially acceptable."""
"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is absolutely a mixed bag of tricks. The high points are stratospheric, but the low ones are frequently head-scratching."
"Forget best movie of the summer, it's the best movie of the year."
Tom Cruise takes the franchise to new heights with breathtaking - soul snatching stunts.  Hayley Atwell steals the show...literally
"Tom Cruise's stunts are a 5/5, but Dead Reckoning Pt 1 has a particular scene that is so detrimental to one of the best characters, that it took me out of the film. "
The new Mission Impossible is the summer movie we've all been waiting for.
We all must agree that one of the best things about the new Mission: Impossible films is their selection of badass women with powerful on-screen magnetism.
"Mission Impossible—Dead Reckoning: Part One has jaw-dropping action that inspires awe. While entertaining with solid chemistry, parts of the movie feels flat."
"Tom Cruise reprises his now iconic role of IMF agent Ethan Hunt, giving yet another powerhouse physical performance that reaffirms his status as the most enduring (and best) action star in the business."
"As energetic as one dares to hope a popcorn movie might be, in love with the capacity of movies to provide every sort of visual delight."
"An extremely lively, stupid, grotesque, and entertaining experience. [Full review in Spanish] "
The franchise remains undefeated.
"Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One  honestly dropped my jaw. McQuarrie infuses Tech Paranoia, Hitchcocking intensity, white knuckle action set pieces that remind you why movies like this *MUST* Be seen in theaters. "
"MI7 does offer summer escape but I can't help but think what a really efficient, fast-paced actioner Dead Reckoning could of been if it had been conceived as a single movie."
"Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One is more than just a movie for me. It’s one more well of motivation that’s keeping me from succumbing to the immeasurable forces at play, i.e., the algorithm gods and their fanatics."
"As expected from a Mission Impossible film, the action sequences, stunts and fight scenes are top tier. Cruise hasn’t lost a beat, still performing his own stunts, kicking ass and running around with Usain Bolt type speed."
Franchise still delivers out-of-this-world stunts but screenplay needs work.
"How do you come up with a worthy adversary for someone who demonstrably thinks of themselves as infallible? Tom Cruise has solved his own problem; in the impossible-to-follow Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, he takes on God Himself."
Mission: Impossible remains a unicorn amongst action franchises either topping or closely masking what has come before. This team and its leaders in Cruise and McQuarrie are delivering action spectacle like few others and this is no exception.
"The latest installment of ""Tom Cruise's Jackass"" is a blast!"
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, Part One may not be the best film you'll see this year but it's most certainly a film you won't easily forget. "
"Adrenaline-pumping sequences, flirtatious interludes, high pitch drama and a save-the-world plot do their jobs. However, something about the process doesn’t feel new."
"Kudos to Cruise for knowing his audience and how to please it. He nails a nearly impossible mission: becoming the summer’s box office savior riding a sequel, again, while performing stunts that would terrify actors half his age."
"The third act more than makes up for lost momentum with its stupendous stunts that Cruise nails, A tip of the hat to the greatest risk taker in Hollywood history, surpassing early practitioners Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton. Breathtaking."
"Tom Cruise once again puts his life on the line, diving into the stuntwork with gusto while adding some underlying moodiness as a secret agent whose job might be getting to him. Above all, it's a thunderously entertaining movie."
"With thrilling action sequences, a talented cast and a fearless leading man, Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One is an absolute blast. One of the best action movies you'll see this year."
"Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One has all the bells and whistles as McQuarrie and Cruise deliver on another great film.

Incredible sound and production throughout, strong stunts, a compelling story and an amazing score are all present."
Cruise and McQuarrie have once again collaborated to make a poster boy summer blockbuster that lovingly embraces what makes the big screen experience so uniquely special.
"McQuarrie’s lasting contribution is a style of intensely pressurized efficiency. His films push the Mission: Impossible franchise away from espionage melodrama and toward a spectacle of function, of situation and action over emotion and impact."
"A crowd-pleaser and then some. This mission, to pull the theatrical experience of cinema back from the edge of death, is an amazing hat trick that combines the tangible with the abstract. Alchemy? Almost."
"Cruise skating by the skin of his teeth, and narrowly escaping would-be captors and death dealers alike, feels more like a Chaplin boxing match than any boringly grounded contemporary superhero feat."
"The first half of Ethan Hunt's sizable final adventure isn't without its narrative shortcomings, but it does immerse you fully in accepting the mission with new backstory, characters, and a state of the art villain, buoyed by amazing action spectacle. "
"McQuarrie and Cruise deliver the must-see movie of the summer. Astonishing stunts and practical effects, a well-timed narrative, humor, and Esai Morales as a series-best villain. "
"Dead Reckoning Part One is a vigorous dose of action filmmaking at its finest, due in no small part to Cruise and McQuarrie pushing themselves further with each entry."
Well-executed thriller that's all spectacle and no substance.
Stingy with the stunts...
"Action set pieces and visceral action make Dead Reckoning an ideal blockbuster. However, enough goes wrong in Dead Reckoning to leave it as one of the weakest entries in the very good franchise."
"Cruise's latest slice of intercontinental intrigue will have you experiencing déjà vu all over again, not only because it trots out the oft-filmed scenarios, but because he stopped doing the very thing that kept the franchise on its toes."
"It's the ultimate proof that Cruise has become Mr. Movies (™)—THE Hollywood star who knows exactly how to lure us to the big screen, justifying the existence of this kind of ridiculously budgeted blockbuster. Full review in Spanish."
"Dead Reckoning Part One is (so far) the cumulative masterpiece of the M:I franchise, featuring a plot that’s very timely while immersing itself in elements from the series’ past."
"It’s dopey but thrilling, and I recommend seeing it on the biggest screen possible while you still have the chance."
Top-notch action hides a whisper-thin plot for a great summer action thrill ride.
"Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning, Part One honors the filmmaking techniques of yesteryear while injecting them with invigorating contemporary freshness. [Full review in Spanish] 

"
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I boasts some of the best action footage you'll see this year. Moreover, a strong cast adds enough nuance to keep the story from seeming like an excuse to vault from one dizzying set piece to the next."
"There are no new surprises in the new MI instalment -- in fact, McQuarrie assembles the film more as a fan than like a maker, distilling it down to its greatest pleasures."
“Reckoning” is the film of the summer -- an old school throwback to the bygone days of action blockbusters.
"Reducing cinema to gimmicky sensationalism is regressive, especially when McQuarrie’s repetition is this witlessly conventional. "
"Dead Reckoning Part One is reliably great. But like many recent Cruise-led projects, it’s also deeply concerned with the future of cinema."
A mean-spirited film with nothing to redeem.
"It’s brimming with both warmth and cynicism, cementing a Santa perfectly attuned to the times and emblematic of the joy and anguish that pervades this time of year... a new Christmas classic."
"Violent Night is one of the biggest surprises of the year, instantly becoming a contemporary Christmas classic! David Harbour expertly embodies a shockingly brutal, savage version of Santa Claus that somehow still delivers lovely messages."
"Violent Night is an instant CHRISTMAS CLASSIC. A bloody, gnarly, & goofy time that brings the laughs, the action, & Especially the Christmas magic! David Harbour is the definitive most realistic Santa Claus you could put into a movie"
"No sane person will consider Violent Night a perennial classic, but Harbour inspires enough ho-ho-hos and cheeky holiday mayhem to warrant a watch."
"If there’s one thing about Harbour that has always sung, it’s the charisma he can generate with just about material and any actor on screen. He’s also a very big man, standing tall and making a dad bod seem more desirable than Zac Efron ever could. "
"If I want a bad Santa, I’ll watch Bad Santa. That’s not to say there isn’t some measure of worthy seasonal jeer in Violent Night."
"It’s not a holiday classic like Die Hard, but it is a decent temporary remedy for the mandatory holiday cheer."
"""Violent Night"" is as-advertised. It’s more vicious than one might expect from this action comedy, but it starts at a high-level of foulness when Santa upchucks on someone and just continues on from there."
Fun take on Santa Claus but we have to hold Harbour up to Billy Bob standards.
"Excessively violent, laced with a thick vein of jet-black humor, bolstered by a formidable turn from Harbour, and packed to the rafters with hard-hitting scraps, Violent Night knows exactly what it wants to be, but doesn’t really try to be anything else."
David Harbour owns the screen as the at-first grumpy but still very caring and ultimately badass Mr. Claus. 
"“Die Hard,” and Michael Dougherty’s “Krampus,” meets “Bad Santa,” with full shot of Christmas adrenaline."
"An excellent Harbour leads the cast, and a terrific Legui-zamo makes for a perfect antagonist."
"It’s heartwarming violence, a very merry massacre, and holly jolly hammer time but it also put me in the Christmas spirit. "
Many movies have attempted to replicate the festive insouciant brutality of <i>Die Hard</i>. No movie has come closer to this lofty goal than this dementedly delicious nightmare before Christmas.
Bad Santa as John McClane may believe it is being a kind of subversive anti-Christmas movie alternative but its best moments involve not violence but our hero rediscovering the joy that the season once provided as its own relief from the world's evils.
"It's a Santa flick where old Saint Nick is a rough and tumble action hero. Imagine Die Hard meets John Wick meets Home Alone. It's a lot of fun and quite over the top and bloody, but in a strange way, a little endearing at times, too."
"Violent Night is an unforgettable new Christmas action classic, perfect for those who want to hate on Die Hard being a holiday classic—now you have one that is undeniable."
"With Violent Night, we were promised a deranged, Santa-meets-Die–Hard flick shorn of holiday schmaltz. Instead, the action-comedy just another soppy movie about the Christmas spirit."
"But you can’t miss Violent Night. An action vehicle that doesn’t hold back for a bit, this is the movie that nobody knew they wanted but is now the movie we need. "
"The illegitimate love child of Bad Santa and Die Hard, which compels a hungover and disillusioned Saint Nick to dole out season's beatings when he should be delivering presents to sweetly slumbering children."
Santa has something clever and violent for grownups.
"If David Harbour doesn’t commit to the bit so hard in this he delivers a genuinely great performance, it’s just a lark. He’s just way too good of an actor to keep this from floating away."
 a manic but enjoyable Christmas snack.
...a decidedly larger-than-life premise that’s employed to erratic yet entertaining effect...
"This action-packed effort is as irreverent as it is endearing.

"
"The result is no Christmas classic, but it's a jolly good time that should appeal to the inner child (and jejune sense of humor) in us all."
"Violent Night isn’t just a horror movie. This is a really inventive, super fun sleigh ride with better-than-average dialogue, and energetic fight scenes with a man dressed in several layers of fur and leather."
"Amidst all the scenery chewing, there's nobody having as good a time as Harbour. His Santa is John McClane by way of <i>The Northman</i>, but it's the little things he brings to the part  that really stand out. "
"The finale of Violent Night is so good, I bet most people won’t care about the choppy storytelling before that, because the climactic action is just so fun and over the top."
"Very self-aware, Violent Night knows just what tropes to poke and when to lean into sincerity. The film shares a similar tone with Deadpool 2; while it goes for gut laughs, you don’t leave with a caustic feeling."
"The script needs some work and there are too many characters, but Wirkola’s film has great fun turning Christmas on its head."
One of those bad movies that keeps piling on things that make it worse and worse as it goes on.
"A solid-enough mainstream stab at Christmas comedy-horror—albeit not nearly as clever as 2016’s undervalued Better Watch Out, another twisty home invasion tale."
"The tone fluctuates wildly from scene to scene, from sweet holiday comedy to acerbic social satire to intense action shoot-em-up. But it all works. "
Violent Night overcomes its weak script and familiar concept with enough ooey gooey squelchy violence to appease bloodthirsty horror fans and action junkies alike. It still manages to be a bloody festive blast filled with head squashing Christmas carnage.
"Director Tommy Wirkola stages the mayhem creatively, with acrobatic moves and maximum bloodshed, and with a gleeful abandon that confirms the movie is on the comedy side of the action-comedy divide."
"Die Hard in a Manjer. One of the big film surprises of the year, you won't have to be drunk on spiked eggnog to enjoy Violent Night."
"It’s like attending a party where no two guests are on sufficiently good terms to manage even 20 minutes of civilised conversation. “Perfect for Christmas Day then,” I hear you say. Too cynical."
"It was never boring, [and] I think you'll dig it, especially if you like action movies with some comedy."
"What audiences will get in their stocking is a bit of naughty and nice, with a narrative structure that throws back to 90’s action, and a delightful performance from David Harbour as jolly ole’ Saint Nick."
"I could not help but visit the theater for this Christmas movie, which features what ought to be a fun, irreverent concept, like 'Bad Santa' (2003). Unfortunately, the mix of comedy, sentimentality and violence doesn't work very well this time around."
"112 minutes of your life rather than a day, which is a small gift..."
"For all its devil-may-care mishmash of tropes and bludgeoning mayhem, Wirkola’s jape is not quite up to scratch as a future Christmas-nasty classic. "
"A riotously fun spectacle starring a lovable, murderous, man bun-sporting Santa Claus trapped in a mediocre story."
"Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house Santa and his sledgehammer waited to pounce. It’s funny, crude, action-packed, and worth the price of admission thanks to David Harbour's low-key Santa and John Leguizamo's over-the-top Scrooge."
"David Harbour is everything here as Santa, and carries the film as effortlessly as the sack on his back."
"There is a brilliant sequence that re-imagines what would have really happened to the bad guys in ""Home Alone"" had the traps been real, but the rest is just pointless violent and unlikable characters from Santa to Scrooge"
"It has a ton of heart, even when that heart is being pounded into mincemeat by a sledgehammer."
This is the best idea for a movie that anyone has EVER had for a movie.
This is an absurdly entertaining holiday movie with the attitude of an action romp.
Violent Night offers up a timely amalgam: It is torture porn that is also a morality play.
"Violent Night is an entertaining dumb movie, and if you like the kind of R-rated film you can laugh at, put this one on your December movie list"
Violent Night is the definitive anti-Hallmark Christmas movie.
"Terribly violent, if you have a weak stomach, this may not be the film you want to see. "
This film perfectly blends the gore and violence yet still gives you that warm fuzzy feeling a holiday film does. A must-see! David Harbour was made for this role.
"David Harbour makes a particularly good cranky, butt-kicking Santa, in a movie that offers the sort of shared experience that should bring theaters some much-needed cheer.

"
"But it has its moments (the Home Alone tribute is particularly inspired), and I certainly don’t begrudge anyone who finds some joy in this work. You should feel free to talk to me again once your tastes improve."
"David Harbour makes for a great, butt-kicking Santa. First half a little slow, but it definitely builds up to bloody glory. "
"Big on gore, but not much more."
"Violent Night is not great cinema, but it does exactly what it sets out to do: Entertain and delight holiday crowds who would rather flinch and whoop as Santa breaks bones than cheer big holiday musical numbers. "
Violent Night gives an interesting spin to the cheesy Christmas movies.
"The Santa action, which does not truly kick off until a good length into the film, feels a little lagging and soft compared to the ultra-kinetic brawling we’ve come to expect from these kinds of films."
"Violent Night feels like someone got frustrated at everyone saying Die Hard isn’t a Christmas movie and they responded with, “Hold my nog.”"
"Violent Night ultimately executes its thematic templates exactly as we’d expect, despite its singular blend of sensibilities."
"... While combining the character archetypes of Die Hard with the bloody slapstick of Home Alone, it’s in absurdity that this film thrives."
"Good holiday movies are few and far between and while Violent Night isn’t top shelf, it’s a holiday actioner that gives its lumps with glee. "
A fun and bloody Christmas infamy with the real Santa as an accidental hero. [Full review in Spanish]
"""Behind all the gore-splattered walls and domestic rancor lies a sweet-and-sour bedtime story of good triumphing over evil."""
"Overall, Violent Night is knockabout fun, but if only the script wasn’t so pleased with itself."
"The movie mostly seems interested in pushing its R rating, and it loses itself in that relentless pursuit. It’ll be a blast for some. But for those who burn out on its gimmick, I can see it being an endurance test."
There is enough anti-holiday magic and grim cheer that it contends for the coveted spot of ... repeat offender for many Decembers to come.
"The fight scenes are competent; the gore and gunfire are plentiful, there are some reasonably clever kills, and the occasional kidding of action movie clichés are welcome. "
"Full of blood, gore, and strong language, this is no kids' movie, but Harbour's lovable performance and a gleeful irreverence around the familiar action scenes make this a fun holiday gift. "
"Violent Night does exactly what it sets out to do, and does so with panache, frivolity, and style."
"If a drunken Santa Clause tearing through bad guys on his naughty list sounds like a good time to you, Silent Night won't disappoint! Violent Night is a very silly, stupid movie. I happen to like silly and stupid movies. "
"If the sound of Santa swinging his sledge hammer like Thor while yelling ""Naughty Naughty"" doesn’t jingle your bells, this aint for you."
"Despite all the gore and violence and other R-rated material, it’s arguably less offensive than the kind of bilge proliferated by Netflix and Lifetime/Hallmark/etc. in the name of Holiday Cheer."
Harbour’s jaded charisma is the film’s secret weapon (that and a massive hammer).
"As far as over-the-top holiday movies go, this could definitely become an annual tradition in some households."
"Knows how to make its familiar parts gleam when it wants to, but that isn't often enough. 

"
Amalgamates its spiritual ancestors for a rollicking action-comedy with its tongue—as well as a candy cane—lodged firmly in its rosy cheek.
"Wirkola never quite resolves whether he’s riffing on Christmas movies or delivering something genuine, and the uneven result doesn’t work."
"Violent Night is a great movie to watch with an audience. Despite all the violence, there's an honest Christmas spirit here. "
"Violent Night manages to deliver the heart of a traditional Christmas classic in between the blood-spraying and bone-breaking violence. The action is fun, the humor is sharp, and David Harbour embodies everything you want in an ass-kicking Santa Claus."
"Violent Night is as insane as a Santa Claus meets John Wick premise should be. David Harbour kicks all kinds of ass, and the fights are even more brutal than expected. There are unnecessary story points along the way, but the final result is a good time."
"Despite refusing to tip a few scales in the favor of those attempting to rob the rich to feed themselves, Violent Night still manages to conjure its own holiday miracle—the desire for a sequel in a market glutted with them."
David Harbour is perfectly cast...
"Violent Night isn’t the first film to deliver an R-rated Santa Claus story, but it’s one of the best if you find the idea of jolly old St. Nick engaging in a bit of the old ultraviolence appealing. "
"The sort of wannabe cult action-comedy that gets off on its own displays of horrible behavior and listless set pieces, this Santa-goes-berserk story wants to be a new alt-holiday classic."
The movie is a bloody good time enjoyed most in a collective space. David Harbour is a killing machine as the very endearing and not-so-jolly Kris Kringle. It’s a must-watch for a silly and gory escape.
"It’s a fun and brutal holiday romp with a great performance by David Harbour, but it doesn’t quite reach the level of peak action it promises."
"Intended as a satire, it is gory and unpleasant, mean-spirited in the extreme, and entirely without purpose. The most extraordinary thing about it is that it ever got made at all."
Violent Night is a jolly good time wrapped in glorious barbarity.
"Ingenious at times, Violent Night is rowdy yet innocuous, playful yet inconsequential, savage yet pleasant, and unapologetic, sheer fun... "
If Violent Night had one goal — to be a Christmas movie for adults pumping with bloodlust after surviving the shopping mall parking lot — then it succeeded.
I'll be honest with you: I enjoyed this movie. I'm totally down for a prequel and/or a sequel. I want to see more from this world I want to see more of the David Harbor Santa Claus.
A surprisingly large success in my book.
"A dark yuletide comedy with a twist -- and a gouge, and more than a few crushed skulls -- Violent Night is clearly hoping you’ll be having too much fun to say “ho-ho-hold on a minute” to some of its faults."
"Fun movie. Craig Gillespie films are always solid. Not as much pizzaz as THE BIG SHORT, but similar ensemble vibe."
"Good story, good acting but the total movie never connects with the audience as it should."
"Dumb Money gets into the underdogs who gamed the system, and it’s hard not to tap into the mood."
"There's something about this story — maybe it's too simplistic, maybe it's the fact that the actual events are so recent that the film can't comment meaningfully on their potential future implications — that makes its populist bent feel contrived."
Craig Gillespie’s film guarantees unbridled fun with its uncompromising re-telling of how a cat-tee-clad Redditor/YouTuber and his loyal followers caused a never-seen-before revolution in Wall Street.
"Beyond being a work that serves as a testimonial about this enigmatic case, the film is at most fun and not much more. [Full review in Spanish] "
"The hedge fund guys are still thriving, still doing exactly what they did before, perhaps with a trifle more caution. "
Turns what is technically a very boring financial story into a highly entertainment film. Paul Dano and Pete Davison are sensational - the soundtrack could have been a lot better though.
"Taken as a whole, “Dumb Money” is a pretty smart dissection of how messed up the financial system is, and why some very rich people prefer it that way."
Memes sometimes have a way of making a joke of their reference object but not at the reference’s expense. That's Dumb Money.
"Dumb Money is slick, admittedly entertaining stuff but, in reconfiguring whatever fleeting battle was won as a series of fist-pumping financial figures, it merely confirms that the system wins in the long run."
You can’t help but feel there was a great movie brewing that got chucked off the boil.
"A cautionary tale as much as it is one of conquest, it’s difficult to think Dumb Money won’t serve as something of a blue print for wannabe stock enthusiasts who want to become a little more savvy in their financial moves."
"As directed by Craig Gillespie, a lively cast led by Seth Rogen, America Ferrera and Pete Davidson lean hard into the absurdity of this David-vs.-Goliath tale with most amusing results. "
The writers care about even their smallest characters.
"Dumb Money is relatively restrained for such a wild story, but it’s an engrossing one all the same."
"Director Craig Gillespie moves things at a cracking pace, punching the point that no rule in the business world, however sacrosanct, is immune from the collective will of people who barely know what they’re doing...Terrific stuff. "
"Dumb Money is a hugely entertaining yarn, brought to life with real wit and poignancy by director Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) and writers Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo."
DUMB MONEY is uninspired with all of its most important beats told to us through mundane montage. 
Dumb Money is a mostly fun look at a brief moment in which working class underdogs tipped the scales in their favor. For once.
Craig Gillespie's The Social Network
Isn’t it time that Woodley received a role that is befitting of her strong emotional range and naturalism? She is completely underused here. 
"Dano and Woodley can’t rescue the film from the valleys into which the story sinks. Happily, the mountains are high when they’re on-screen, but there aren’t enough mountains to climb for others. Too much occurs that comes across as flat and unfocused."
"Two-and-a-half years on, GameStop is still struggling, and the system is still rigged. But for an hour or so, the little people can jubilate in their historic moment of collective power."
"What are audiences supposed to do with this, anyway? In the midst of the constant buzz surrounding the stock market, Gillespie's film struggles to find its footing. "
"Keith Gill is a character that could've fallen into caricature, but Dano is capable of grounding him and making him relatable. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The acting in this film is strong and effective. The characters are interesting and the story is compelling. It is funny and dramatic, and very entertaining. "
"It’s fun to watch, though it misses the mark with some of its characters."
"That such a specialized story is so pleasant, fun, and even exciting is to the merit of the dialogues by Angelo and Schuker. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Rather than a feel-good story, Dumb Money’s overenthusiasm in depicting small victories ignores a harsh reality. "
"It’s impossible to operate in the real world right now, with union strikes popping off like fireworks in a frying pan, and not get swept up in a movie that thumbs the eyes of the elite. "
I could barely keep my eyes open during this unfunny snoozer packaged as a wannabe heir to Adam McKay’s 2015 film “The Big Short.”
"Dano makes an effective central presence. As he's shown in many previous roles, he can use his unassuming moon face to turn on a dime from a seemingly passive, guileless pawn to a conniving antagonist."
"Dumb Money never pays off because of a muddled concept, weak characters and a failed effort to create any real winners in the tale of the little guy versus big financial institutions. Interest starts low and keeps dropping to the point of tedium."
"I think Dumb Money is completely worth seeing, but I can’t say you need to go in person to the theater to enjoy it."
Craig Gillespie once again draws inspiration from a real case to praise small investors who dare challenge large investment funds. [Full review in Spanish] 
"Gillespie has a knack for spinning stranger-than-fiction tabloid headlines into compelling entertainment. Dumb Money bursts off the screen with the same anarchic exuberance as Gillespie’s earlier successes, I, Tonya and Pam & Tommy."
It is a movie of such fun performances from every single one of the characters. Everybody is just giving it their all. 
"This movie is brilliantly seamed together with a sprawling cast, but in my mind they weave it well to create a very compelling story. You find yourself rooting for the ""average Joes"" to stick it to the rich folks."
A fun and fast-paced comedy about a populist financial uprising.
Paul Dano's performance is what makes this movie so great. He blends into the character and seamlessly becomes an analyst who wears cat sweaters and posts memes about the stock he finds interesting. 
"Documentaries may have beaten it to the punch, but Craig Gillespie's film livens things up with a great cast and some solid laughs while putting more of a hopeful spin that somewhere over the rainbow the rigged system can be taken on."
"In the words of GameStop, ‘power to the players’ – Dumb Money is a game worth playing."
"There’s a much better version of Dumb Money out there in some alternate universe, but for now, this will do. After all, like Keith Gill said, I like the stock."
"...a very, very hit-and-miss comedy that is, to increasingly distressing effect, more the latter than the former..."
"Though rough and messy, Dumb Money makes for an entertaining and relatable recount of the GameStop stock story. "
"This little film has its flaws, but basically, if your bank balance is less than nine figures, there will be something here for you to enjoy."
Director Craig Gillespie’s new film Dumb Money transforms the 2021 GameStop short squeeze into a rousing comedy about everyday Americans turning the tables against the financial elite. It’s the best “COVID movie” so far.
"Learning the nitty-gritty of this unprecedented stock market event is thrilling, especially since the movie is briskly paced."
Director Craig Gillespie treats a serious true story with an appealingly light touch...
Paul Dano’s performance elevates this film far above it’s best line or sharpest edit. 
"It's true, it's funny, and it's smart."
"Dumb Money remains watchable, perhaps because it sweeps past us without worrying too much about dotting every ""i'' and crossing every ""t.''"
"Strong performances, an interesting topic and a compelling mixture of archival footage and staged content aren’t enough to escape the film’s insistent mediocrity."
"Taking clear cues from The Social Network in look, feel, and even score, this is serviceable “punching-up” drama with a good ensemble cast. Don’t expect it to stay that long with you, however."
"Despite The Big Short-ish pace and rapid-fire gags, there's a sadness hanging over Dumb Money."
"Despite its cynical sentimentality, Dumb Money worships dumb money."
"It’s deeply sympathetic towards these people, who are only trying to claw their way out of a trap. It also leaves its own breadcrumb trail of warnings that suggest the community they’ve invested in may not be their salvation."
"Takes a story in which a group of people were seen in the popular imagination as scrappy underdogs, and doesn't really do anything to question or interrogate that"
"I liked the film/performances, & I used to love the stick-it-to-the-man genre of capitalist criticism. But let's face it, the 1-percenters will always find a way to win the way the system is set up, despite momentary setbacks. Anyway, Pete Davidson rules!"
"Like Gillespie's I, Tonya, it's a funny but empathetic portrayal of people who've been reduced to punchlines in news articles."
"The film plays with a single card, [Dano's] timid interpretation, that triumphs and goes beyond simple imitation, gifting the protagonist with an air that is both clueless and sagacious. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Odds are you’ll...like “Dumb Money.”  It might simply have been a real-life helping of Capracorn, but thanks largely to Dano it’s more substantial than that.       "
"Even with all the finance jargon, Dumb Money has a lightheartedness to it and some humorous lines expertly delivered by the cast."
"Focusing mostly on the power of the internet, especially social media, as a means of calling to action among people who would otherwise never connect. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A feel-good story about the smarter-than-you-thought pack of misfits who gamed a rigged system, via GameStop, and scored a touchdown for the little guy."
"It is never as biting as it should be, although it does give visual and narrative agility to the event... [Full review in Spanish] "
"For a Quixotic, quick turn-around comic thriller about stock market winners, losers and supervillains, “Dumb Money” isn’t half bad."
"There’s certainly a very cerebral, sharply scripted version of this film somewhere else in the universe. But the Dumb Money we got is serviceably funny and narratively competent if nothing else."
Dumb Money is a masterclass in audience emotional manipulation.
"Paul Dano is the standout, capturing the courage, doubt, and charisma of someone who accidentally became the voice of the financially depressed in an epic David versus Goliath scenario."
Paul Dano never misses in this eccentric film that reminded me of The Wolf of Wall Street meets The Big Short. 
"A thoroughly entertained viewer will be finger-pointing insanity occurring, in some shape or form, at nearly every turn of this off-the-cuff, firebrand movie."
Accomplishes its Money-For-Dummies-Like-Me mission admirably.
Dumb Money is worth investing your time in.
There’s enough class resentment in this film to warm the heart of Noam Chomsky.
"Sounds dry and simplistic, but the script from Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo is vivid and visceral, and somehow brings the stultifying grimness of that central pandemic time block back to painful life."
Dumb Money is a giant middle finger comedy to the establishment that’s hilarious and empathetic.
"Gillespie manages to make this financial story tense, funny and surprisingly rousing."
The Big Short (2015) managed to make the intricacies of the housing crisis both understandable and entertaining. Dumb Money never explains the mechanism behind a short sale or why the short squeeze proved so disastrous for institutional investors.
Dumb Money is the first mainstream movie to show how sad and unfair life really was during COVID. 
"It's rife with F-bombs and other unapologetically raunchy expressions that are likely to shock most people over 40, but if you can endure that, you just might learn something and laugh all the way to the bank."
"...We get to partake in a fun re-enactment and see an intriguing overview of the circumstances that took place, (but) the film also becomes somewhat difficult to personally and totally invest in."
While the film might have slightly defanged its depiction of the users of the subreddit r/wallstreetbets... it is undeniably perceptive about the insidious influence of social media as a whole.
There is a tenseness to this film that keeps you engaged.
…. bloody hilarious and well worth your time.
"Dumb Money is Gill’s Campbell-esque hero’s journey, and thanks to Dano, it’s one I’m very glad I went on."
Dumb Money...certainly works well as a crowd pleasing film.
This chronicle of the weird January 2021 boom in GameStop stock is waggish fun.
"The mostly young investors in ""Game Stop"" stocks face-off with wealthy hedge fund owners who literally were betting against them, and Gillespie's hip cast makes the whole historic revolution a lot funnier than it really was or, honestly, ever should be."
"It’s not a bad way to spend a couple of hours, keeping in mind that this fairy tale, like most, has only a tenuous link to reality."
Paul Dano excels in this true tale of how little-guy investors took down billionaire Wall Streeters. Call it a slapstick tragedy with a windfall of laughs
"If there were ever a need for a movie to be 75-80 minutes, this is the film I would put up for that... It feels stretched and also not enough due to the script."
"This stock market story is a worthwhile buy, and Dano is perfectly cast to bring order to the on-screen chaos."
"Paul Dano heads a sprawling cast as the guy leading the rebels with pitchforks on behalf of GameStop, resulting in a film that’s smart and satisfying enough to earn every dollar it makes."
"In January 2021, the DIY operation comes to a head when the bigwigs conspire to take back the upper hand. The film does a superb job of showing the difference between the haves and have-nots by contrasting the space, light and décor of their surroundings."
"'Dumb Money' is pretty good, even if the culture of instant nostalgia that forced it to rush into production to beat out nine competing projects is pretty terrible."
Explores the universal themes of dreams and ambition while also reminding us that there’s a lot of power in the bottom 99%
There are  a dozen or so characters that all get arcs and all have stories but none of them are explored enough
"Dumb Money doesn’t have the same market value as The Social Network, which has a major hold over its entire stock. Pro tip, you should be selling instead of buying into this mid-movie.
"
"Where the reactionary slashers of the ’70s and ’80s exploited their young audience’s appetite for sex and effectively punished them for it, Talk to Me is a thoughtful attempt to figure out what really frightens teenagers today."
"Everything an audience might want from a horror movie is here: original ideas, quality acting, jump scares, rising dread, and a powerful sense of allegory."
"Talk to Me is uncompromising and emotionally brutal, it’s gross and smart, and I haven’t been able to get it out of my mind since I saw it."
"Disembodied hands have long been a mainstay in horror cinema, and it’s to the credit of the Philippou brothers that they’ve come up with a unique approach to the errant appendage."
...it is easy to label [Talk To Me] as one of 2023's best horror films.
The majority of the feature demonstrates the capacity of the Phillipou's to be at the service of their characters and for their fabrication of a tense environment that is more and more desperate.  [Full review in Spanish]
"It works like gangbusters until it really doesn't. Still, there is something to be said for a near miss that leaves you somewhat intrigued for what the filmmakers will do next. "
"It has a good rhythm and curated visual work - characters that appear slightly blurred, dark lighting, overwhelming close-ups - that contributes to creating a disturbing atmosphere throughout the film. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Talk to Me is TWISTED, TERRIFYING, and the BEST HORROR film of the year. Directors Danny and Michael Philippou deliver inventive and genuine scares that will linger long after watching."
"Despite its flaws and the relatively simple concept, Talk To Me proves to be a successful spookster for the majority of its runtime."
"The debut from YouTubers-turned-filmmakers the Philippou brothers makes for sharp, bloody viewing, even if it runs out of steam"
"Although Talk to Me isn’t particularly innovative, it does show considerable skill from the Philippous, who show some inspired visual acumen and keenly balance the gross/scary/funny equation, two things that better horror films do."
"Talk to Me is a sleek, frightening, and unique construction that digs into teen loneliness and dispossession through actual possession. It is literally bone crunching and ferocious with gore aplenty but is also empathetic."
"It's committed to the darkness of its premise, and I like that. "
"Despite its minor issues, Talk to Me is still a hell of a debut feature and an excellent Australian horror picture. Wilde is absolutely terrific in it as Mia and the Philippous inject new ideas into ancient formulas. "
"TALK TO ME is extremely effective as a horror film, but I don't know if its ambiguity (in the end) completely works as its final moments are arguably misguided. "
"A supernatural horror film that shakes hands with topics about the grief of loss and adolescent fragilities, but whose core remains trapped in a chapter of possessions and jump scares that lack any kind of chills. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The concept is cool. The performances are solid, with a haunting atmosphere that keeps the tension going during crucial moments... but I couldn't connect at all. [Full review in Spanish]"
A refreshing Horror film that builds on its story & characters over just visuals that will shock you. Fantastic film.
"The shock value of the violence and terrifying imagery is enough to stay with you long after you leave the theater so be warned. However, cinephiles will know that since it's an A24 film, it's going to stand out in more than a cheap jump scare way."
"A frightening and innovative tale of grief, loneliness, and the dire consequences of messing with the dark arts."
"The Philippou twins, aka YouTubers RackaRacka, make a chilling feature debut as they chart Mia’s journey from cherished friend to exiled girl alone and in grief and guilt. "
"The Philippous refreshingly mine their own viral video experiences, as well as the potent concept of trauma allowing otherworldly forces to take body control. The confident style and sharp imagery make this worthwhile viewing for horror aficionados."
"""Talk to Me"" is a compelling watch, showcasing skilled direction, emotional depth, excellent sound design, and a standout background score. Although it excels in many aspects, it falls short of perfection and the hype surrounding it."
"Gripping from the beginning and unrelenting in its terror, Talk to Me will surely be the source of nightmares for many."
"Talk to me is pure horror. A creative, rebellious and fast-paced study of anxiety in the age of immediacy. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Despite its flaws, we can say the Philippou brothers have debuted with the right foot forward. Or rather show that they have a good hand? [Full review in Spanish]"
"It’s cool, unsettling, and a return to a recipe that I often worry has been forgotten. Talk to Me is the kind of movie that reminds me of why I fell in love with the genre."
"With a fresh take on the genre formula, the Philippou siblings deliver a truly scary and unsettling modern horror story. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Incredibly effective.
"It's beautifully cast, and I think we get to make judgments about the characters -- and we actually sympathize with them -- without them being mawkish or unbelievable."
"Talk to Me feels fresh, due to the emotionally grounded performances of its young cast, and how the Philippous continuously raise the stakes on the consequences of their characters’ horrendous choices."
"Danny and Michael Philippou achieve a horror film that, even though it stays on well-trodden paths, knows to reach its own destiny where boredom and cell phones reveal its most tragic and fatal side. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Talk To Me is a brutal, relentless movie unafraid to go places mainstream Horror rarely visits in contemporary Cinema. Its unique and efficient set up place it one step above from siimilar productions."
Talk to Me has the effervescence of a debut film and the technical solidity of a career that's been simmering for years. [Full review in Spanish]
"Filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou emerge as the promising new voice of horror. It’s frightening, well-crafted, and on par with genre greats Wes Craven and Sam Raimi."
"A decent effort, but doesn't hit like the best horror does. "
"Imagine an early M. Night Shyamalan movie, such as The Sixth Sense, stripped of all the director's fuzzy optimism and belief in serendipity, and you're starting to grasp the mood of Talk to Me."
The twin brothers of Danny and Michael Philippou have found the right formula for a modern horror tale.
"A young, talented cast and a captivating production make a horror film that aficionados of the genre should not miss. [Full review in Spanish] "
A brilliant deconstruction of the habitual history of the ouija. [Full review in Spanish] 
"Although the film's plot is not without holes, Mía's drama is so convincing that they get relegated to the background. [Full review in Spanish]"
"With a solid year for horror, Talk To Me stands out as something fresh and chilling. Honestly, this is the type of film to haunt you after."
"In addition to well-crafted horror scenes, the film is supported by a disturbing color palette and a mix of confounding sounds and real noises, and it touches upon fears that are very natural. [Full review in Spanish]"
Director and co-writer Danny Philippou and director Michael Philippou bring us an eerie story with unexpected violence that is the source of the horror. The level of violence will make you look away or gasp like the crowd in my screening.
"TALK TO ME is a terror filled movie that burrows its way into your worst nightmares. A gritty, seemingly simple horror film that uses a fantastical object to make a sinister and brutally truthful commentary about the dangerous power of unresolved grief."
Talk to Me works so well because it knows when and how to build a scene with latent tension. Each séance possesses superlative intensity. [Full review in Spanish]
"... A bloody story that while it also rewards with themes about addiction, mourning, and the darkness of loneliness, it never loses its intent: to put forth a horror movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A legitimately thrilling first act sets the stage for a movie we will never get, making for a resolution that nails all the technical aspects, albeit with a frustratingly predictable narrative. "
"The direction, acting, editing and especially sound design are all flawless. Alas the narrative - which feels fresh in the front half - becomes too pedestrian and familiar in the back half with its focus on Mia's grief."
"This is a superbly made debut that marks out both Philippous as serious horror talents to watch. Their next film can’t come soon enough, even if it ends up being Talk To Me Too.
"
"Though not the masterpiece it's being lauded as, Talk to Me is a good (and at times very good) entry into this well-trodden and popular horror genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Talk to Me holds you in its grip until it’s over, but that’s it. On the strength of pure craft and ambition, the Philippous have earned entry into the elevated-horror club; maybe as they grow and develop as directors, they’ll renounce their membership..."
"One of the scariest horror films in recent years! Impressive practical effects, superb makeup, hypnotizing performances – Sophie Wilde clearly stands out the most – and impeccable execution of truly shocking, gory, unpredictable moments of violence."
A supremely terrifying film mixing the horrors of the restless undead with the greater horror of emotionally absent parents.  
The themes of grief and loss in Talk to Me are felt very much throughout the story. The film has a very creepy ending that isn't typical of most horror movies.
I expected it to be much more of a thriller. It was just average all way round.
"From its gut punch of an opening to its poetically ironic ending, directors Danny and Michael Philippou wring viewers dry with their masterful horror film “Talk to Me.” "
Grittier and more naturalistic then many would have expected it to be.
"Talk to Me is a gripping dialogue on the dread and vulnerability of love, loss and longing."
"“If there are ghosts, we probably shouldn’t TikTok them possessing us” is a simplistic but alarmingly sufficient argument. No notes."
What separates Talk to Me from some other entries in this genre is just how unrelentingly cruel it is.
"Talk to Me's unsettling atmosphere and uncanny visuals will leave you on edge throughout, and its clever, sparing use of effects adds to the authenticity of the supernatural stuff. This film will not just scare you, it will chill you to the bone.  "
"While some horror fans may argue the movie doesn’t quite nail the ending, all will readily admit this production does much more right than it does wrong."
"What drives the film and its scares are the excellent lead performances. Aside from the directors, this movie is also a great introduction of an actor like Sophie Wilde, who brings a wide-eyed, human intensity to the role."
"Everybody does a great job, but Sophie Wilde is the star of this film... I thought she was phenomenal: human, vulnerable, and scary all at the same time.
"
"Horror movies can be really good with a minimal budget... You don't need big-name actors, [you just need] a good premise. And this movie has a great premise."
Talk to Me brings a fresh and unique spin to the otherwise cliche-ridden subgenre of haunting/possession movies. The first-time directors achieve an uneasy sense of dread that makes for one of the most effective horror movies of the year.
"There are moments when the movie makes the theater feel like a vacuum, sucking you into a vortex of heart-racing, chest-clutching, jaw-dropping terror. It’s the enthralling kind of horror that you can’t look away from."
The silly humour and the earnest writing make this inherently watchable. It’s clear there’s an intense love of the genre through every frame of this film.
"The naturalistic dialogue, realistic relationships, and character-driven plot points -- enhanced by the performances of a tight and talented cast -- make the supernatural scares and brutal violence hit the viscera even harder."
"The ensemble never steps out of character, no matter how improbable the situation. While Wilde and Otto are the standouts, best supporting actor must go to the embalmed hand."
... tailor-made to become a cult classic... a script that gets under your skin as much as in your face... delivering horrors promised while fulfilling the needs of the story... possibilities will live rent-free in viewer's heads after the credits roll. 
"...a complete misfire that does, in the end, take itself way, way too seriously."
"One sad, scary allegory on why kids shouldn't do drugs — especially if they're going through personal pain."
"Talk to Me is a lot of unsettling fun. The Philippous show tremendous promise, and Wilde has the entrancing screen presence to become a major star sooner rather than later."
"Flies by with thrilling energy, plenty of nightmare fuel, and inventive ways that make the very tired possession subgenre come alive again"
A potent mix of psychological and visual horror.
"Though the resulting film owes much to the like of Flatliners and the Evil Dead, it’s a solid launch pad for the Phillippou brothers."
"Beyond being a great horror movie Talk to Me is one of the best films of the year. Sophie Wilde gives a star turning, tour de force performance you can't take your eyes off of. "
The movie steadily generates a palpable sense of unease that culminates in a handful of genuinely chilling scenes and one cracking ending that makes the film’s frustrations a little easier to digest.
"It might’ve been slightly oversold to horrorheads as a new height of never-before-seen terror, but at its best, Talk To Me still packs a grisly, dread-inducing impact."
"This is horror of the highest order, the kind that leaves you feeling both giddy and unsettled — almost as though you’ve allowed some strange force in and aren’t sure whether you want it to leave."
"It’s like painfully spicy food; it hurts in places you didn’t know you could feel, but the reward is worth the pain."
Talk To Me is a good movie that both serves its horrorcore and has intelligent observations about high school behavior.
"The film's emotional depth may surprise fans of the Philippous' raucous, ultraviolent YouTube channel RackaRacka. Make no mistake, though, the brothers demonstrate cracking filmmaking skills."
"There are just enough emotional undercurrents to make it feel like there's depth to the characters, but even this is adeptly deployed to freak us out in properly disturbing ways."
"Even if Talk to Me falls away towards the end, ditching satire and sass for ghosts and ghouls, every new generation needs a horror to call its own, and this, like The Blair Witch Project in the Nineties, may just be that. "
"Though it leans on familiar genre tropes and stylistic conventions, a devastating script and charismatic cast (spearheaded by Sophie Wilde) make Talk To Me a terrifying and pervasively heartbreaking tale of grief."
"Signals a strong new voice in the genre with the Philippous that is equally confident, commanding, and committed to slinking under your skin."
"Talk to Me is meticulously crafted to scare the shit out of you, haunting you long after the credits have rolled."
Potent and evocative meditation on grief and addiction.
"A completely original, frightening, terrifying and shocking horror film led by a captivating performance from Sophie Wilde. More horror films like this please!"
A scrappy little effective horror movie 
"The Philippous blessedly resist relying on jump scares and put their trust in the power of disturbing imagery. Even still, these jolts prove far too few."
An auspicious debut. There’s a bracing meanness to the movie that keeps you guessing where it’s gonna go.
Talk to Me defines what makes indie horror so dang fun
"I'm not particularly a big fan of scary movies, but this movie was terrifying - in a good way. This is one of the better scary movies I've seen in quite a long time. "
"Actors as incisive and persuasive as Wilde, Jensen and Bird break your heart a little, while the trials they endure are making that same heart race."
...skips the random set-piece killings you might expect and tightly focuses on familial horror and doom-laden dream logic...
Charming and impeccably scored...
"Thoroughly preposterous, utter bourgeois fantasy of a romantic comedy."
"Kate Winslet is one of my all-time favorite actresses. She's known for making heavy dramas and period pieces, but I love seeing her in a lighter, more comedic movie..."
"Not much more than a trans-Atlantic take on the same gloopy matters addressed by Love Actually, but it an effective date movie nonetheless."
"While some people might accuse Meyers of sleepwalking in her latest film, The Holiday, it still worked for me thanks to a likable cast and some rather smart dialogue."
A great example of an affable rom-com. [Full Review in Spanish]
"You begin to suspect that Meyers isn't actually a movie director at all, but a features coordinator at World of Interiors."
"Nancy Meyers pulls off a classic comedy tribute...the cast pull it off, selling their characters' singlehood, nailing their occasional sight gags and earning our laughs and tears, which often occur in the same scene."
"The Holiday is what you want out of a romantic comedy, without expecting the moon."
"Nancy Meyers is a whiz at turning out fun, frothy commercial fare."
"Grindingly predictable and sickeningly convenient, it's as false as a plastic tree."
"The Holiday is as corny as it gets, but in a cinemascape full of macho grunting and aggressive irony, Meyers is perhaps right to believe that corniness is what women - and their boyfriends - will be wanting..."
Isn't it reassuring to know in these troubled times that it's possible for gorgeous rich people to find love?
Each scene in The Holiday is more annoying than the last.
One of the best date movies I have seen this year.
Who cares if the housing-swap conceit makes little to no sense?
"What makes The Holiday interesting - and worth reexamining more than a decade after its release - is that unlike most holiday-themed movies, it exhorts the viewer to take time for themselves, not just others. It's the ultimate self-care flick."
"If you're looking for a ""good"" movie, I don't recommend this one, but if you want something fun that you can still understand after vaping all afternoon, ""The Holiday"" is perfect."
"Even with the beautiful view, this is one holiday I wish I hadn't taken."
"A reminder to all producers: alluding to iconic romantic comedies in a bid for legitimacy can be a dangerous game, even when you have appealing stars."
Patronizing antimatter
Dialogue hits the floor like frozen eggnog in writer/director Nancy Meyers' protracted exercise in cliché-mining.
"It was if I was watching two simultaneous films, while by themselves may not have been too arresting, but cut apart and pieced together made an absolutely fun and winsome date movie."
I have absolutely no qualms in saying that I didn't really like it.
"My reaction to The Holiday was no different from my reaction to Meyers' other pieces. It's cute enough, the atmosphere is sufficiently romantic comedy-like, but somehow, for some reason, I just don't bond with it."
"As a voracious consumer of chick media (I like alien shoot 'em ups too!), I tell you that the story arc is extremely surprising & delightful, and that you fellas can feel safe watching this as well."
"No amount of ironic gift wrapping can conceal the triteness within, in this double-plotted festive chick flick that is too long by half, and too cloyingly sweet to be healthy."
"About as far removed from burning your bra as you can get. Too much of this chick flick feels like work, with the unfortunately long running time sandbagging it with a kind of cinematic jet lag."
"a warm, charming, extremely clever and often hilarious romantic comedy that will be a sure-fire date movie for any guy looking to please his significant other"
"Meyers gives it an honest shot, but she can't distract from a paint-by-numbers plot just by having us watch it dry."
"While the director tips her hat to classic Hollywood comedies -- Iris watches Howard Hawks's His Girl Friday for lessons in leading-lady ""gumption"" -- The Holiday wallows in too much earnest relationship talk, without saying much."
"Because everyone is rich and in love, you can see the happy ending coming a mile away, but with a film like this, it's the journey that's important and not the destination."
"Sweet, sentimental and sickly."
A leisurely feelgood rom-com.
"A lot of ideas are circulating and the characters have taken hold of our emotions. If only Meyers had taken the quickest way there, it would be a much better movie."
The Holiday's redeeming feature (and it's a considerable one) is the 91-year-old Eli Wallach's astute and endearing performance.
"Give this to The Holiday: It lives up to its title. The writer-producer-director, Nancy Meyers, who last created the delightful Something's Gotta Give, knows how to throw a yuletide bash."
"The movie clocks in at just under two and a half hours, so the staying-awake part may be a challenge for some, but not one scene in the film feels extraneous or doesn't serve to tell the story."
"Watchable, but overly long and ultimately disappointing romcom, despite spirited performances and the occasional sparkly moment."
"This romantic comedy ends up feeling soggy, syrupy and so bloating it'll put you to sleep before the pudding's done."
""
"It would seem that Meyers wanted to make an old-fashioned romantic comedy but the result is formulaic and phony. And no amount of crying, conga lines, cute children, champagne or Christmas cheer can change that."
An entertaining romp that succeeds on a level of pure escapism.
Nancy Meyers é uma diretora medíocre e uma escritora sem talento.
"The Holiday pretends its happy endings are premised on the women realizing their capacities as leading ladies. Really, what they're doing is finding the ""right"" men, not quite the same as finding ""gumption."""
The Holiday works its magic because Meyers invests time in the characters instead of the scenarios.
Writer-director Nancy Meyers' fluff machine is on overdrive...
"A very pretty, safely balanced, sweet and sour film, for some nice bonding time with your other half."
"Running away from a broken heart has never been so much fun as in The Holiday, a delightful romantic comedy about love, life and making a change."
At least 60 percent of this film tries too hard to be as cute as a Christmas puppy and just ends up piddling on the carpet
"A finely polished piece of romantic cinema, with a generosity of spirit so all-encompassing that it's easy to forgive its occasional excesses."
Saying that Nancy Meyers' The Holiday is the best of the year's Christmas movies to date isn't saying very much.
We can all figure out where this thing is going but getting there is the prime attraction here.
"There are bad movies, and then there are Nancy Meyers movies."
"Myers has established herself as Nora Ephron Lite, which is the same as establishing yourself as white bread without the crust."
Fast food merchandising of the heart.
"Despite the honeyed charms of its female leads, the 138-minute Holiday wears out its welcome ... When Diaz meets Law's cloyingly adorable two girls, it's like choking to death on a saccharine candy cane."
"Through its awkward meet-stupids and believable meet-cutes, ""The Holiday"" rings so many notes of joy that you can't help but like it."
It takes a certain amount of power to convince four talented actors to deliver performances that are shrill and irritating.
The Holiday is too predictable and at 138 minutes way too padded to thoroughly enjoy.
"Nancy Meyers' trademark thinking comedies always deliver a perceptive perspective on relationships, but this one forgets to be funny too."
"There's a minute glimmer of joy to be had from this frosty piece of cake, but you have to work awfully hard to find it."
There's nothing authentic or personal about The Holiday -- it's as chilling as heart-warmers get.
"The characters pace and putter around in the story like animals building their nests, and by the time they finally settle down with their mates, we have a grudging affection for them."
"There's good news for Jude Law fans. With The Holiday, the actor has taken a sad career song and started to make it better."
...The story goes on at untoward length.
"...The surprises would be surprises only if this is, like, your fourth movie ever."
"Admittedly, this is a chick-flick. Guys may groan but gals are gonna love it. Like 'Love, Actually,' it's the Christmas comedy you've been waiting for."
"While Meyers overwrites and has a tendency to dwell on her stars goofing around, her best material makes the less-successful stretches worth sitting through."
"Watching The Holiday is a little like ordering a sticky cinnamon bun: You know the gooey, warm sweetness will taste good, but you'll feel guilty eating it."
It's actually one of the most educational chick flicks of the decade...
"Admitting that it's formulaic doesn't make it any less so, but it's enjoyable in a mushy, easily digested sort of way."
"...It's the women who come out the worst in Meyers's sexist worldview, where men are hopeless and women are helpless."
"Winslet, who's never done a Hollywood romantic comedy before, turns out to be a natural, blushing prettily and smiling so broadly the camera seems ready to embrace her."
The Holiday suffers from a dreary predictability.
"Winslet, Black, Law and to some extent the others are often swell. But the script limits are still there, knots in the weave, and you need to be a goner for manipulation not to notice."
"Winslet gets time to build a lovable, kind character. In the process, the English actress known for serious roles shows she can handle just about any part -- even one in a formulaic American romantic comedy -- with exceptional grace."
"It's a pleasant-enough premise for a romantic comedy, created by an experienced veteran (director Nancy Meyers), and is boosted by entertaining performances."
The sheer volume of intense emotional content has a cumulative effect that will easily win over anyone whose heart and mind are open to it.
Winslet brings a sweet enthusiasm to Iris' emotional blooming that makes you wish Diaz... had taken a holiday.
"It is a fizzy champagne cocktail that provides a pleasant buzz, many smiles, and Jude Law with the role of his career."
There is evidence in The Holiday that the declining value of the dollar appears to have distorted the status of leading men on both sides of the pond.
"Any holiday movie with a dollop of sweetness and a touch of wistful deserves a little slack at this time of year. This one is pleasant enough, but The Holiday won't be one you'll remember after the eggnog has worn off."
"For all its charm, there's nothing in The Holiday you haven't seen in a dozen romantic comedies."
"The movie, which runs two hours-plus, has its highs and lulls, but the charismatic cast offsets flawed storytelling."
"Complaining about the gooey and generic The Holiday is as useless as railing against fruitcake -- this is a slick, throwaway chick flick designed to provide nothing more than mindless diversion between bouts of shopping."
The Holiday is a harmlessly cheery confection.
"Although it is inoffensive and well-intentioned, The Holiday is neither the sum of its parts nor an especially effective whole."
"This melding of comedic minds is one of the better holiday gifts we've received, cinematically speaking."
"There is so much to not like about The Holiday. Yet this humorous romantic fantasy is really, really easy to enjoy."
"[Director Nancy Meyers] hits all the notes of the chick-flick formula -- heartbreak, ice cream, Aretha Franklin -- but she never creates a melody."
Way too much cute.
"The Holiday, like the holidays, will require some girding up, and is best met halfway with a self-immunizing smile."
"Obviously intended as a romantic throwback to the good old days of Hollywood, The Holiday instead comes off as a self-indulgent, insipid piece of seasonal trash."
The Holiday is as advertised: a respite from everyday demands and acquired cynicism.
This romantic comedy has an almost terminal case of the cutes.
"The Holiday isn't a great movie, but it should appeal to those who like their movies comfortably upholstered and primed to tug at the heart strings."
"The problem with Nancy Meyer's romantic comedy The Holiday is that it is contrived, too long, and insufferably cute."
The Holiday is a drippily sentimental and contrived movie that ladles on the treacle with a particularly heavy hand and strands some good actors -- and not so good ones -- along the way.
A visually inventive and thought-provoking continuation of the latest franchise reboot...
It does justice to this central character who we’ve spent so much time with and genuinely care about.
"War for the Planet of the Apes squanders its actors, FX, and formal presentation on a story that feels lazily compiled from other material, marking a bitter end for Caesar and this otherwise admirable trilogy."
"""War for the Planet of Apes"" is a full-bodied epic of glory and pain that matches and then exceeds the moving importance and heart this rebooted franchise has established in two previous knockout films."
The best entry in the rebooted series and might be the best film in the entire saga. It's a genuinely risky and powerfully adult tale told with the biggest canvas possible.
War for the Planet of the Apes follows Spider-Man: Homecoming as an example of how to allow a franchise to continue to expand and breathe rather than trying to keep it mired in by-the-numbers numbness.
'War' narrows a global conflict into a personal drama of blood revenge and blind belief that continually ratchets up the tension until one gigantic and cathartic release spills forth onto the screen.
"By referencing the Vietnam War and modern-day conflicts, this franchise-boosting epic apes a number of classic movies."
"Great effects, great performances. [Full review in Spanish]"
The third film of Fox's new Apes films is the brilliant culmination of what this series has been driving toward.
Proficiency in computer imagery has reached such an astounding degree of realism that the digitally synthesized simians here truly come alive onscreen.
"Don't discredit this Apes trilogy as a standard Hollywood remakes. The conclusion is epic, thought provoking, and proves its light years ahead of the old Heston films."
At its worst it continues to be an immensely entertaining and substantial summer action flick.
War for the Planet of the Apes is not only a poignant film but also the most satisfying conclusion to a trilogy in a long time.
I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I needed to know the full story of Caesar and make sure that him and his tribe would be safe. [Full review in Spanish]
War for the Planet of the Apes proves a moving saga and provides a satisfying closing chapter to what's become one of cinema's best blockbuster trilogies.
"War for the Planet of the Apes is an emotional end to a fantastic journey. It's not your average summer blockbuster, and that's what makes it nearly perfect."
"There's a depth here that most big-budget films simply don't even aspire to, let alone achieve. And if the visual effects team doesn't take home the Oscar, nothing should."
"War for the Planet of the Apes is a great film, and it's the end of one of the best science fiction trilogies made in years."
"Have you ever dreamed of a world where you could see The Bridge Over the River Kwai, Star Wars, Apocalypse Now, The Great Escape, and The Ten Commandments remade with gorillas, monkeys, and orangutans?... We finally live in that world."
podcast review
The motion-captured apes look amazingly real and convincing.
"Emotional, action-packed and beautifully shot, War for the Planet of the Apes delivers something that some film franchises have failed - a brilliant threequel."
A great closure to a great trilogy that made us all believe again in this wonderful premise. [Full review in Spanish].
"Putting aside the flaws, this is a satisfying end to Caesar's trilogy, there's a feeling of finality throughout the film, kept together by some killer performances, top notch visuals, and tension-heavy scenes."
This is a well constructed film with good pacing and understandable motivations.
This is the third sequel all franchises should aim to have in their filmography. War for the Planet of the Apes is one of the most sincere and one of the most human films to experience from 2017. Andy Serkis is a monkey god among men.
It's nothing short of astonishing.
A film that groans for grace amid the brutality of a dog-eat-dog world.
"Its sensibility, its sense of the spectacle, its complex characters and the impeccable work of the director Matt Reeves are only factors in an equation that combines art and entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The vehicle may be pretty, but it's still just spinning its wheels."
"Serkis' performance is what gives the film its humanity - we actually care about these computer generated apes, because Serkis and the rest of the cast imbue them with such soulful realism."
"The focussed nature of its vision is impressive but as the film marches, the slightness of its story moves from deliberate precision to repetitiveness."
War for the Planet of the Apes is an extremely satisfying conclusion to one of the best trilogies that has come out in recent years.
One of my favorite films so far this summer.
Director Matt Reeves and his team should be very proud of what they have accomplished with this film.
A thundering end to a powerful trilogy.
"The film successfully delivers nuanced ape characters, without ever feeling artificial."
"War for the Planet of the Apes firmly cements this franchise's status as the smartest, most thoughtful blockbuster action series going."
"It's relatable. It's affecting. And it's deeply moving. For a film about a bunch of talking apes, that's a triumph in itself."
War for the Planet of the Apes is exhilarating and melds together an expert level of craft and performance that shores itself up as one of the delights of this Summer
"The three films (stand) consistently as a strong trilogy, and in my mind, ... one of the strongest. Often, quality slips with each entry, but (these) get stronger as they go."
War for the Planet of the Apes is the biblical epic for our time...
An epic conclusion to an epic trilogy that fully cements Serkis as the best motion capture performer for now and forever.
War for the Planet of the Apes is an emotional yet thrilling ride that will leave audiences satisfied with how this chapter closes.
"Prove[s] emphatically that you can make a big FX-driven blockbuster that will entertain crowds but also tell a smart, compelling story full of complex characters and interesting, thoughtful ideas."
This series of films hangs entirely on the shoulders of a fully formed digital character. It's a remarkable bet... and resulted in what is pound for pound perhaps the best modern trilogy since the Lord Of the Rings.
"As Caesar, Andy Serkis delivers in ways that make the Academy's refusal to acknowledge his work all the more embarrassing."
"[Matt] Reeves' fandom since childhood for the franchise is evident in every frame of his Apes pictures. This is a grim story of loss and hate and revenge, told against the even-grimmer backdrop of the literal end of the human race."
"War for the Planet of the Apes does a fantastic job of rebuking toxic masculinity and centering nonverbal communication, but it forgets to lift up women or people of color in its ambitious goals."
"Whilst War for the Planet of the Apes' title may be somewhat misleading, the film itself is anything but a letdown."
It makes the fall of humanity an engaging spectacle. And now I openly welcome our new ape overlords.
"There is inelegance here between expression and meaning that is jarring, and makes this a grim watch at times."
"The end result isn't quite as effective as Dawn before it, but War delivers the emotional heft to bring the trilogy full circle. Can we give Serkis an Oscar nomination yet?"
"As simians and Homo sapiens touch base with their lowest, the Planet of the Apes' prequel series reaches its peak in quality."
"A chillingly daring finale that swings through the vines, leaps, and sticks the landing, providing a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy."
What could have just been a title-grab sequel is instead a genuinely moving experience.
"War for the Planet of the Apes builds on a central tenet - ""apes together strong"" - and sends out resonating values that we can all learn something from."
"Andy Serkis' Cesar is incredibly spot on, the strong core of this morality play versus Woody Harrelson's Colonel, the embodiment of human evil."
Go apes!
"I was captivated from the start, and remained awed throughout. It seems the third time's the charm for this latter-day reboot of the Apes franchise. It's consummately grand and original."
"An eerily symbolic narrative that fuses multiple genres (prison film, melodrama) with deeply political subtext about hate and isolation."
Never has Caesar been better developed and searched than in this film.
You cannot help but root for Caesar as much as you cannot shake the feeling that in the gamut of life and evolution humans may not deserve to be saved.
"Despite its 2.5 hour run-time, it never feels dull, with a constant complex yet natural progression."
It's what sets great science fiction apart from another Michael Bay Transformers movie: decisions having real benefits and consequences that may not be readily apparent.
"War for the Planet of the Apes is definitely the most fable-like movie in the rebooted Apes trilogy, with its starkly defined war of good apes against evil humans. But it's also the most character-driven story too."
"Having the technology to capture said performances is extremely gratifying, as War for the Planet of the Apes gives a legitimacy to a season otherwise known for less intelligent films."
"This is that rare film capable of holding even the most boisterous and fidgety of audiences in stunned silence, all the more impressive when it's while a room full of CGI apes are communicating via sign language. That is cinema."
Do not miss this visually impressive film. [Full review in Spanish]
"A blockbuster adventure that combines epic spectacle, moral complexity and surprising emotional depth."
"I really enjoyed it as I walked out, and it's only gotten better as I thought about it and slept on it."
"Visually gratifying and epic in scope, it's a memorable conclusion to a brilliant, re-imagined trilogy."
The new Planet of the Apes series has been given a fitting and powerful conclusion.
War for the Planet of the Apes is a thrilling end to a groundbreaking trilogy.
It has the freshness of a story that you're hearing for the first time.
Does not disappoint. [Full review in Spanish]
... a memorable piece of modern big budget filmmaking.
I found the machinations tedious - the film is more than two hours long - and there isn't much tension regarding the eventual outcome.
Reeves combines the feel of a war movie like Apocalypse Now or Platoon with the flashy special effects you find in most summer movies. This gives us a rare Hollywood blockbuster that is as deep in story as it is dazzling to watch.
Who'd have predicted that the prequel to a 1968 movie about a planet of simians who speak like humans would become the most intelligent franchise of the new century?
A fitting send-off to one of the best blockbuster trilogies in modern cinema.
"War for the Planet of the Apes is poetic blockbuster storytelling, the kind we don't see enough of anymore. Director Matt Reeves continues to excel handling delicate subject material"
"War for the Planet of the Apes manages a deft balance between allusion, esotericism, and obviousness that in part explains the runaway success of the series."
War for the Planet of the Apes brings the trilogy to an end with a fitting conclusion.
"It tries to hold a mirror up to humanity, but merely provides a romp through a forest of empty signifiers."
"Simply put, this study of humanity is phenomenal cinema."
A stirring conclusion that features great special effects and another incredible performance from Andy Serkis.
"The action, as in the previous films, is intense and the pacing is brisk, which isn't usually the case for a film almost 2 1/2 hours long. That being said, if this is the final film in the series it's going out on top. Hail Caesar!"
"""Sequelitis"" is like the simian flu that's killing off the human population. It's easy to catch. But, director-co-writer Matt Reeves and writer Mark Bomback apparently got their flu shots."
"Andy Serkis for another thundering performance. If you thought he was good as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films, then his superlative performance here will just blow your mind away."
"While War pivots around the test of wills of the colonel and Caesar, the movie demonstrates a sense of humor, particularly with Steve Zahn's Bad Ape, who got his name by being admonished so often by humans."
War for the Planet of the Apes is a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film that balances action and special effects well enough to make it stand out from all the blockbusters seen so far this year.
Reeves has made the closest thing to a silent movie that we will likely have in today's Hollywood zeitgeist
"There's no doubt the end result here is impressive. But if Serkis does ever win anything, he'd be wise to make the visual-effects team first on his list of ""people to thank""."
"Consistent with the latest generation of these Boulle-based films that started in 2011, it examines the question of who is bestial. Man or ape? It answers the question with an intelligence not often found in Hollywood blockbusters."
War for the Planet of the Apes is concerned less with spectacle than it is with delving into how one defines humanity and what are the right paths to take in order to claim rightful equality.
"These are movies about gorillas who ride horses that feel, at first blush, like kiddie fare. And yet, once you take the step to suspend your disbelief, this is one of the sharpest franchises about the human condition."
"While it is dark in places, War rounds out one of the best trilogies out there."
"Puts such a perfect period on the saga, not an ellipsis."
Is this the worst Hollywood festive rom-com ever made?
"Thanks to a satisfying performance by Witherspoon and Vaughn's dependable comic chops, Four Christmases is a modestly entertaining holiday film for the entire family."
A tried and true formula that's like a repackaged Christmas gift; it's sort of comforting in its predictability but totally lacking in solid film form and originality.
About as predictable as socks under the tree.
""
It's too sparse in the comedy to be really successful--every good joke is in the commercials--but it's got some heart and that counts for something.
"Maybe if Four Christmases had extended itself beyond white trash targets and projectile vomiting, we could've been talking about a new Christmas classic right now."
"Movie-goers heading to see the romantic comedy Four Christmases might want comedy, Christmas cheer and chemistry, but nobody gets everything on his wish list."
How many Academy Award winners can a studio put in one cast and still turn out a bad movie?
"Although not a yuletide classic, Four Christmases is better than most of the holiday-oriented slop put out in recent years."
"For all of its snarky holiday/family bashing, Four Christmases wimps out in the third act and reaffirms all the traditional values it affects to mock."
Maybe catch one of the other hundred holiday films to be offered over the next few weeks and wait for Four Christmases to come to your local Red Box.
Grows tired long before the end credits start rolling at the 80-minute mark.
"There is no spark to the humor, there is no warmth to the drama. There is a tired plot that whips the essence of every Christmas movie ever made into a dreary slog"
"Feels like they wanted to make 5 different holiday movies and couldn't decide which plot line was best, so they rolled them all together, glossing over everything."
Projectile baby vomiting is a recurring gag. I cried mistletoe well before the film was halfway through.
Feels both too cluttered and too safe.
"This is marginally better than most, with a few offbeat comic ideas, a reliably droll performance from Vaughn, and, as the parents, four watchable old troupers in search of a fat paycheck."
You can see most of the big slapstick set-pieces looming long before they hit but there are a few smaller routines that pack a punch just because they have an unexpectedly manic tilt to them.
An embarassment for all involved.
"Four Christmases boasts one of the most impressive casts ever assembled to make a movie that is, at best, only mildly amusing."
A good start to the holiday season.
"Filled with 'hilarious' scenes of people being vomited on and falling off roofs, Four Holidays tries to meld nasty, black-hued comedy with warm sentiment, resulting in a sick melange of treacle and malice."
"An imperfect storm of horrible writing, awkward casting and questionable taste gathers soon after the opening credits and dumps downpours of buzz-killing humour at depressingly regular intervals."
"There are worse holiday-related ways to spend your time than Four Christmases, I suppose. Making a three-hour drive to grandmother's house in pea-soup fog, for one."
"Four Christmases is the kind of film that you should only watch if you're trapped on an airline and can't fall asleep, the kind of holiday film that makes Jingle All the Way look like a cinematic tour de force."
"So monstrously awful that it will probably make a fortune, spawn sequels and cause a mania for gags involving projectile-vomiting babies."
"Witherspoon and Vaughn play two characters who are totally unlikeable, and the movie as a whole is too."
"Gordon's stars are charmless, his script cheerless, and his sterling supporting cast can't seem to figure out what they've been brought on board to do."
Didn't quite get over the hump.
"Oh, the hilarity of hating your family at the holidays."
"Even apart from the retarded and retread contrivances that provide context for their argument, Four Christmases is intensely disturbing in its class politics."
"Vaughn and Witherspoon are plainly uncomfortable in their roles,... two of the flattest performances of any romantic comedy of recent vintage."
"Proving that quantity does not equal quality, director Seth Gordon (The King of Kong) presents Four Christmases, a weak, soulless holiday film in spite of its inclusion of five previous Oscar winners."
"A top cast just manages to keep Four Holidays afloat but the script offers too few laughs, and slapstick turns to schmaltz before we've had enough Christmas Cheer."
...lowbrow humor that fails to delight.
"I hope I meet a girl who can keep up with me like Reese Witherspoon. Not a blonde though. Sorry, not my type."
"Despite a horrible trailer that seems designed to keep people away, this is an entertaining movie with good performances by Vaughn and Witherspoon."
"Letting the hulking Vince Vaughn near a Christmas movie is just like giving a knife to your crazy drunken uncle during a seasonal family gathering--it's reckless, pointless and ultimately foolish in concept."
"Although the list is rather short, maybe Vince Vaughn should think about throwing in the towel when it comes to starring in movies that deal with some aspect of Christmas."
"Vince Vaughn tries his best at ab-libbing his way through the film, but Witherspoon seems to have no clue what she's doing. If you're desperate for a Christmas comedy, rent SURVIVING CHRISTMAS instead."
"Witherspoon works hard to convince us otherwise, but this is a miscast mess. Definitely a turkey rather than a Christmas pudding."
"Even with the clich and rushed ending, the flick survives on its clever dialogue that made me laugh out loud a dozen times."
"The mix of gross-out gags, slapstick and saccharine sentiment should boost the sale of indigestion tablets this festive season."
"These embarrassing truths, indeed the entire film, take a great deal of hard swallowing. The mawkish ending is thoroughly predictable. But it's not quite as ghastly as the ingredients might suggest."
"In this egregious Christmas movie, Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon each demonstrate the classic ""Hollywood romcom"" face: waxy as a corpse, dead-eyed with self-loathing."
Seeing such talent wasted on this dross is dismaying.
"But as syrup and cynicism congeal into one painful clot, there is never any doubt that this is a major studio's crack at the Yuletide market."
"Witherspoon and Vaughn are physically ill-matched. She has never looked tinier, while the always gigantic Vaughn has put on so much weight that I half-expected the big plot revelation to be that he'd eaten her twin sister."
This bit of festive froth is nothing original but it delivers enough moments to make you smile.
A laboured romp.
"A fabulous cast is thrown away on forced gags; still, by the genre's standards the message is interestingly complex and ambivalent - pro-family, naturally, but with such qualifications that you almost feel it's sincere."
It feels like a long slog toward a half-baked ending that wants to have its sugary Christmas cake and eat it.
Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon play the leads. Do they convince as lawyers or lovers? No. Do they convince as space aliens trying to infiltrate the human race? Yes.
"Average family comedy that's saved by likeable performances from Vaughn and Witherspoon, though it bungles its emotional finale and feels a little flat as a result."
This film is too fragmented to ever come together. Although terrific actors and some serious subtext make it enjoyable.
"Seems intent on being as generic and lowbrow as possible, with broad slapstick emphasized over witty dialogue or interesting characters."
"Director Seth Gordon's debut feature is a mutant meringue of a movie, with the sugar icing oddly squashed beneath the bitter lemon filling curdling on top. The result is an unpleasant goo that's neither sweet nor sour."
"Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon can't bring this Yuletide comedy home, but without their chemistry and respective personalities it would be dire."
What a horrible little movie.
"Witherspoon and Vaughn, for their part, fail to exhibit any sign that they met before shooting day -- let alone are playing characters who have dated for three years."
"The trailer focuses almost exclusively on broad, physical comedy sure to draw the yahoo crowd but not necessarily anyone else. A more representative trailer, on the other hand, would have revealed a movie that's actually worth seeing."
"We've enjoyed their cocky selfishness; just as much, we bask in schadenfreude when they get guilted into making the familial trail of tears."
The film is not a memorable Christmas present for viewers. But it's no lump of coal either. It's passable entertainment with just enough good laughs to make it worthwhile.
Four Christmases is two Christmases too many. Two I could survive. But four of them? Nah. Call me Scrooge. Bah humbug.
"Delightful apart but deadly together, Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn look, throughout Four Christmases, as if they just want to get this thing over with."
"Four Christmases is a fun and fascinating -- if ultimately featherweight -- comedy not only for the whole family, but for every kind of them."
"Four Christmases is refreshingly tart and lean, forgoing the usual schmaltz and syrup of the season."
The difference between the average unfunny comedy and this one is the difference between Grandpa telling you knock-knock jokes and Grandpa telling you knock-knock jokes with his bathrobe open as his hand creeps up your thigh.
Think of it as fun tear-away wrapping on what's essentially a boring pair of socks.
"Vaughn and Witherspoon are clearly having a lot of fun snapping each other's synapses, and their sense of play gives the whole easygoing, formulaic enterprise a welcome jolt."
"Four Christmases generates some laughs here and there, but it's wildly uneven, and too often sets aside the generous gifts of a pretty good cast in favor of cheesy slapstick."
"The cynicism may not hold up as we get closer to the holiday itself, but with a little distance between us and the reason for the season, they did make me laugh."
"It's Four Christmases in need of a wedding, or maybe a funeral."
There's always the underlying feeling that what you're seeing is eerily familiar.
Holiday romcom is amiable but centers on family dysfunction.
One and a half Christmases is about all that's worth celebrating in Four Christmases.
"To brand, then dismiss, Four Christmases as a disappointment would be giving it too much credit -- never, for a second, did this New Line Cinema cast-off scream or even whisper decent in the run-up to its opening."
"To earn a more helpful R rating, the filmmakers should have gone ahead and dropped a couple of F-bombs alongside the references to 'street whores,' nipples, senior sex and vomit."
"Very funny, very touching, and very real, and it's not too hard to believe that, though it might not be remembered as a classic, it'll become a holiday favorite for many."
Several maraschino cherries short of a fruitcake.
"Here's a clue for people who make movies like Four Christmases: if your holiday season is that awful, keep it to yourself."
"As impressive as that is, by and large this wannabe yuletide romantic comedy has about as many yucks and guffaws as a swift kick to the head by a steel-toed boot."
A sequence in which they dress up as Mary and Joseph for a Nativity play is genuinely funny. The rest of Four Christmases doesn't do them justice.
"Vaughn may, in fact, be the best possible representative of our over-caffeinated age -- rambling, reckless, selfish and yet still somehow awesome -- and he's what makes Four Christmases as barely watchable as it is."
"Of the movie's misaligned stars, it's Vaughn who emerges the least damaged."
"Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no."
Do these hypocritical holiday comedies have an alarm clock inside them that goes off when they're suddenly supposed to turn all soft and gooey?
"This being a Christmas comedy of sorts, it demands a happy ending of sorts. And a moral too."
Parental Content Review
"It's not all a total loss... if you like the two stars (I do), you'll love them here..."
That's funny?
ideal for anyone who thinks their family is the most dysfunctional during the holidays and yearns to be proved wrong
Surprisingly deft and sometimes hilarious.
"When will filmmakers learn that if you start with Bad Santa and finish with It's a Wonderful Life, you just end up with curdled eggnog?"
No yuletide season would be complete without the crappy Christmas movie.
A star-studded cast way too talented for the material plod through a painfully rote holiday rom-com.
"The acrid, wince-worthy Four Christmases may well be part of the war on Christmas Bill O'Reilly's always fog-horning about. Christmas and Christianity will survive it. But barely."
Use parental caution when opening this early holiday present.
"Humbling and epic in scope, designed and conceptualised brilliantly, but a tad too stand-off-ish emotionally. While the father-daughter dynamic works in parts, the Cooper–Brand relationship is never given the right treatment and collapses."
This is a film where complex concepts of quantum physics and powerful human emotions are inextricably intertwined and the ghost that haunts the farmhouse has both a scientific explanation and a sense of supernatural power.
"""Interstellar"" pushes the limits for personal interpretation of both science and fiction. Both elements are wildly heightened to a bold scale to address the internal opposites between logic and spectacle, science and sentiment, and brains and emotion."
…uses sci-fi to go beyond into the philosophical and spiritual beyond that few other epics can reach….
"Nolan’s most openly emotional film, he fully lived up to his “Stanley Kubrick’s eye and Steven Spielberg’s heart” identity with this grand sci-fi epic about the sheer force of will that we have for those we love.

"
Interstellar utilizes science in a way that strives for authenticity in a science-fiction thriller and it's why we're still discussing the Christopher Nolan film today.
"As Robert Bresson once said, “I’d rather people feel a film before understanding it.” Interstellar moved me, and I didn’t find myself fact checking the science so I could complain on Twitter."
"Staggeringly beautiful, bafflingly complex, this is proper event cinema. "
"The film demands quite a bit of time from its viewers too, but its big ideas and wondrous sights are ample reward. "
"When Mann appears to explain man, it collapses under the weight of a repeated thesis that doesn’t merit such explicit, redundant reiteration."
It’s a contemplative adventure and an emotional exploration that captivated me from its opening moments.
Rarely do epics of this scope and intelligence reach theaters anymore; such serious commercial filmmaking seems like a market almost exclusively maintained by Christopher Nolan. 
"While not all-together perfect, the film represents a monumental cinematic achievement that deserves to be placed high within the caliber of Nolan’s filmography."
"The inherent message of the film brings hope, but it can definitely get waterlogged by intellectual speak and long-winded scenes."
The film is indeed a sight to behold -- and one that demands to be seen on the biggest possible screen.
"Nolan reaches for the stars with beautifully composed shots and some mind-bending special effects, but the dime store philosophy of the story never achieves lift off."
Audiences are sure to lose their suspensions of disbelief over the nearly impenetrable climax.
...an often insanely ambitious science fiction epic that that remains mesmerizing for most of its (admittedly overlong) running time...
"Scientists will debate, theologians will contemplate, philosophers will wonder, and cinema lovers will bask in the glory of another remarkable Christopher Nolan achievement."
"A big-budget reprise of ideas Nolan has been exploring since the beginning of his career. Not only is it a film about the passage of time, it's also a film about memory."
"None of these characters feel fully-fledged... for a film so rife with schmaltzy musings on the meaning of life, it's alarming how lacking it is in this department."
Interstellar is not Christopher Nolan's best film but what I will say is that you can't deny his ambition.
As spectacular as it is flawed.
"Interstellar is not only a grand space adventure worthy of the big screen, it's also a powerfully emotional story about the bond between a father and daughter, and how that love can drive one to attempt the impossible."
"One of the boldest science-fiction movies I've ever seen, both in narrative and visual terms. [Full review in Spanish]"
It was a blockbuster movie-going experience.
I guess the take away is all you need is love... and morse code?
"Interstellar is, all in all, a very fine science fiction film."
Interstellar is 120 minutes of good movie stuffed into 170 minutes.
Interstellar is Nolan at his most humane. It's a good look for him.
"Overall, Interstellar looks nice but ultimately lacks substance. Nolan essentially loses his way by going to space."
The space voyage is easily one of Nolan's most thought-provoking films yet. It's definitely his most ambitious.
"As far as a masterful visualization of space and an exploration of profound theory, it belongs on a shortlist of must see films which it's comparably akin to... But Nolan's film falls short in other realms, namely the human component."
It's as grand as it is introspective and as grounded as it is existential. By the end of the nearly three-hour running time - it goes by in a flash - you feel as if you've experienced something that is so rarely captured on film.
Christopher Nolan more than deserves however much money the studios are willing to keep giving him to make these brainy beautiful blockbusters.
"Preposterous, pseudointellectual, poorly constructed, clichéd, impenetrably masculine, goofy and possessed of an indecipherable ending, Interstellar is the mother of all misfires."
"Moreso than any of his previous projects, Interstellar left me largely confounded, wondering if Nolan had finally ""lost it."""
"The old saying ""shoot for the moon - even if you miss you'll land among the stars"" has never rung quite as true as it does here."
"There is absolutely a breathlessness to Interstellar, although perhaps too much of that is huffing and puffing."
I found it emotionally moving and... what I wanted in a good sci-fi movie.
"Interstellar may not be perfect, but tent-pole filmmaking with such ambition and grandeur is always worth celebrating."
"With the likes of Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and John Lithgow as supporting players, it is redundant to say that the ensemble adds so much more to a film that boasts excellence in all departments."
"A contrived science fiction film without authenticity, emotionally and narratively."
"A celestial tapestry of space exploration, time bender and heartfelt human story, it earns its place among the stars."
"Literally reaches for the stars -- and comes up short. Despite the best efforts of a talented cast and writer/director Christopher Nolan, this film just can't overcome a script with black hole-size plot craters."
"Interstellar is impressive. It is superbly made, and combines compelling thought about everything from ecology to the nature of time to a child's belief in ghosts into something cohesive and mostly engrossing."
The summary work of Nolan: apotheosis of his signature where he attempts to merge the philosophical and emotional in entertaining genre packages.
"It's the rare combination of a film that's both enjoyable in the theater and afterward, hashing through it over a drink"
"Interstellar magnifies Nolan's style to a tremendous degree, but that also means enlarging his own flaws too."
"For this critic, Nolan hits shy of the mark for cinematic brilliance but still manages to land a visually stunning entertainment in its own right."
Succeeds on a level that has been largely foreign to the celluloid-loving director: the emotional.
"The planets in the new galaxies are creatively different yet familiar, beautiful and ugly, habitable but not habitable. They have their own histories and realities and have no interest in being colonised by the US of A."
"The enchantment of a Christopher Nolan film, the sheer majesty of it, if you will, is surrendering to it."
"Interstellar is an ambitious story, and while the theme of love transcends time and space is a bit shoehorned into the script, it still rings true. Matthew McConaughey delivers one of the finest pieces of acting on film."
I think the reason why I connected so deeply with it is the extent to which Nolan evokes iconic moments from silent films.
"What is wrong with the movie - some of the messages are lathered on so thickly... yet the Nolan brothers assume that all viewers have a keen grasp of quantum physics, relativity, time dimensions and gravity."
"The result is a mess. But it's a beautiful mess, and one that I wouldn't want you to miss for the world."
Watching Christopher Nolan fall short is still more exciting than watching most other directors succeed.
Nolan's refreshing love affair with self-determination goes too far.
"...visually spectacular, complex, and both intellectually and emotionally stimulating...[Full review in Spanish]"
"Visually striking, with an impressive cast... [Full review in Spanish]"
"Christopher Nolan's spectacular film is filled with frustration, anger, and guilt, and also strives for acceptance and even redemption."
"Eye-popping visuals, an ambitious narrative, and a heart-racing soundtrack; one of Nolan's best"
Interstellar is why we go to the movies.
This intergalactic extravaganza is clearly in a class by itself.
Big Ideas served in a movie that is ultimately unsatisfying.
"With all the rampant think pieces questioning the probability of every science fiction film that comes out, it's comforting to across a movie that doesn't really claim to have any of the answers."
"Interstellar is a beautiful, irritating, awe-inspiring mess. It's the kind of movie Hollywood simply doesn't make any more - and that's exactly why you should see it."
"Nolan does (to his credit) and his failure to engage us as fully as he intends... takes us to infinity and beyond, but it's likely you cared more about Buzz Lightyear than you will about anyone in Interstellar."
"It's flawed, certainly, but its vision is undeniably appealing and ultimately the film's saving grace."
"A film made with meticulousness and ambition, that achieves its tasks both narrative and visual with singular efficiency and grandiloquence that never feels forced. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Naturally, Nolan's desire to unite high and low culture doesn't always pay off, yet even when he gets pretentious, I don't hate him for it. Better a filmmaker who fails while overreaching than one who has a hit with Transformers."
"Interstellar, though ambitious and thrilling at points, is too complicated and doesn't reach its full potential."
"Interstellar has more of absolutely everything: more plot, more (stupid) words, more acting and much more bad acting (Anne Hathaway) than nearly all the year's films put together, as well as the most idiotic storyline of the decade."
"It is a wondrously beautiful movie, with intense sci-fi sequences, a solid and talented cast, and even some thought-provoking ideas. This is not one to be missed."
Christopher Nolan is incredibly good at making science-fiction movies for people who think they don't like sci-fi.
"Interstellar never feels overly long despite its almost three hour running time. It also packs an emotional wallop, if you let it."
"It's his 'White Album,' overlong and overwritten, corny and self-important, and also a great movie. And yes, it can be all of those things at once."
"Can we fly a spaceship through a galactic wormhole to Saturn? We haven't even put a man on Mars yet! It's another 342,077,666.43 miles from Mars to Saturn! Fuggeddaboudit!"
"Perhaps it would have been wiser to trim back on several of the ideas and present a more cohesive, not to mention coherent, story."
Interstellar feels like a collection of arresting moments and ideas that don't quite hang together.
The result is a flawed but highly engaging experience that is as frustrating as it is astonishing.
"A blockbuster that's profound, poignant and exhilarating."
"Too literal-minded, too conspicuous to leave us with a sense of doubt and apprehension."
Nolan's Interstellar waxes poetic about the universality of love and lingers beautifully on worlds beyond ours.
A dynamic left-right combo of spectacle and heart that efficiently covers over the screenplay's various cracks and crevices.
Interstellar needs to be seen on the biggest screen you can get your eyes on for maximum impact.
"When the essential property of film forces us to believe in an illusion, [Nolan] has become the least-spiritual director in contemporary cinema."
"This epic film will still leave its mark on our collective memories, for it succeeds in affecting us. However, a bit of humor and humility would have been appreciated in this journey, which takes itself far too seriously."
I can't remember an apocalyptic film that's taken less interest in this planet as it's destroyed.
This is a film rife with mistakes that even a rookie director wouldn't make. How this ended up being made by Nolan blows my mind.
This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.
"[Interstellar] is a mighty science fiction epic built upon seriously shaky science. Yet that's hardly the point when this strives so hard, so achingly, to be profound. And very nearly is too."
"Interstellar may be a failure on a story level, but Nolan's visual virtuosity is still enough to take your breath away and root you to your chair."
"Let's be plain. Christopher Nolan has made a lopsided soufflé of a film, but one with such fine ingredients you can hardly complain about the shape when you're enjoying the taste."
"Interstellar dares it viewers to come along on a perilous adventure that is immersive, impressive, and intelligent."
Nolan is a well-appointed mainstream fabulist who uses a great deal of money and technology to no great artistic purpose.
"...after building up the drama of personal sacrifice, it feels too much like a cheat no matter how many endings are tacked on before the credits..."
"It's just a really weird film, the strangest and most misguided fake-Spielberg picture since Super 8."
Visual splendor does not entirely make up for failures in plotting and characterization.
"Just as in the original, this film is as much about the texture of the world on screen as it is the story of the Replicants 30 years after Deckard first strolled the mean streets of L.A."
"Much like its predecessor, 2049 is a methodically structured puzzle, solved through slow but persistent drips of revelation. "
"That Villeneuve achieves such a cerebral and even touching picture, while also accomplishing an uncommonly sublime production, marks Blade Runner 2049 as a landmark in the science-fiction genre."
"It's immaculately constructed, full of true wonder, and keeps you under its spell all the way to the very end. In some ways, Blade Runner 2049 even surpasses the original."
"Heady science-fiction fans, this episode is for you."
A new chapter. A triumph. A cinematic miracle.
"Unlike the original film, where the ""romance"" feels like a product of Deckard's dehumanized relationship with Replicants, the romance between Ryan Gosling's K and Ana de Armas' Joi, both machines, feels real and keeps the film intriguing."
A skilfully made movie that works as a companion piece to Scott's film and as a detective mystery.
"Deliberate in its pacing and world-building, the follow-up to Ridley Scott's dystopian vision of Los Angeles uses breathtaking cinematography, impeccable production, and a gripping story to make our second visit even more revelatory than the first."
"Slow-burn thrillers don't always work, particularly when fused with science-fiction and brief action, but here the finale is a welcome redemption."
Blade Runner 2049 is a visual feast for the eyes that demands to be seen in theaters.
A rather remarkable sequel.
Blade Runner 2049 is so visually poetic yet intelligently profound that it leaves a haunting linger if you've engaged with its concept enough.
"Blade Runner 2049 can be aggravatingly sparse and sometimes bombastic, taking too much time to say what it wants to. When the pieces fall into place, however, it's spellbinding."
"Blade Runner 2049 is a deep, technically impeccable film that manages to expand the story of its predecessor, pushing it to new heights. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The reason Blade Runner 2049 will be remembered, just like its predecessor, is for its visuals. My God, the visuals."
Blade Runner 2049 just might be the greatest sequel since The Godfather: Part II.
"Blade Runner 2049 is distilled science fiction, as intriguing and profound as the predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Fills the screen with breathtaking visuals that are worthy of repeat viewings, presents ideas that will have you contemplating big-picture concepts for days after you see it, and provides a stage for stellar performances from Gosling on down."
Everything fit together... I was a fan.
This is an art piece.
"The film's running time is hefty, but its pleasures are deep and satisfying. Villeneuve's direction is brilliant, and if Deakins doesn't win an Oscar for this cinematography, the award has no meaning. See it on the largest screen you can find."
"Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sci-fi films I've seen in a long time, and certainly the equal to the first film."
"Echoing a bygone era of studio films daring to push boundaries and expectations rather than demurely adhering to them, Blade Runner 2049 is every bit a soliloquy of dread in response to Scott's ballet of violence."
"Blade Runner 2049 refines Blade Runner's themes and widens its scope with such immaculate skill and savvy calculation that, ironically, I don't think it could have nearly the same impact as Blade Runner did"
"Love the sets and trappings, especially of the nightclub with stars from yesteryear, but the film itself is not satisfying and way too long."
"Blade Runner 2049 was totally not what I expected. Yes, bits of it are dumb. But bits of it are very good, and some bits of it are positively awesome."
The fact this story is so ridiculously nourishing while still leaving me pondering some really big questions will remain one of cinemas great mysteries.
"Blade Runner 2049 is a visual masterpiece, but a drudging descent for the sci-fi genre."
"A masterpiece pure and simple, Blade Runner 2049 does not disappoint and will keep hardcore fans and newcomers alike equally happy with what they're seeing."
"The journey...is slow, deliberate, and well thought out, spending most of its time on drawing questions out of the audience than making an action-filled juggernaut. [February 1, 2018]"
BLADE RUNNER 2049 certainly looks the part but beyond the surface it is nothing more than a pale replicant of the real thing.
Its aesthetic is so outstanding that you can spend 160 minutes nailed to the chair. [Full Review in Spanish]
To call Blade Runner 2049 a satisfying experience would be an understatement.
A film that is thematically complex and visually astounding.
"Is Blade Runner 2049 a masterpiece like its predecessor? Definitely not. It's not even a match for 2016's superb Arrival, the previous film from director Denis Villeneuve. Yet on its own terms, it's a dazzling achievement."
"By syncing so many moving parts into a seamless, spellbinding whole, Blade Runner 2049 is both heady speculative fiction and action thriller at its finest."
"All told, this feels like the best-case scenario for a sequel three-plus decades in the making: it is a glorious visual evolution of its predecessor that retains only the tones and themes it needs."
It does the unthinkable: takes one of the most popular cult films of all time and actually makes a sequel worthy of its name.
"Villeneuve wisely takes the themes of Scott's Blade Runner and explores them from a new angle, while maintaining fidelity to the world built by its now classic predecessor."
A beautiful science fiction epic that doesn't necessarily play like a sequel. A technical masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish].
"Blade Runner 2049 works without the original film. It cultivates mood and atmosphere well. But the original Blade Runner remains in the margins, explicit and implicit, drawing focus."
"One of the most amazing things about Blade Runner 2049 is that is manages to capture the spirit and style of the original, while also feeling completely new."
"The cinematic delights, the abundant literary and film references, thoughtful social commentary and fine acting performances in BLADE RUNNER 2049 will be enough to satisfy many audiences."
I want to live inside Blade Runner 2049.
Thirty-five years was not too long to wait for a sequel of this calibre.
Blade Runner fans and non-fans should definitely check it out and enjoy some striking scifi film noire. Still has some of the pacing problems of the original but it's better
Direction may be classical - restrained and elegantly composed - but his visuals are from another world.
"It's unlikely that Blade Runner 2049 will reach the cult status Scott's original film developed, though Villeneuve's effort is a labour of love that certainly deserves its due."
"After all this time there are now two Blade Runner films, and they're both great. What a weird world we live in!"
[Blade Runner 2049] is a visually stunning and beautifully made expansion of a fascinating world.
"Blade Runner 2049 was a solid movie. I think what hurts the movie, however, is not even the film's own fault. The swelled up expectations and anticipation behind the first film loomed over this sequel."
A stone-cold masterpiece.
"This is as challenging a blockbuster as has been made in the modern era, and it's all the better for it."
An expansive and inspiring followup to the Ridley Scott classic. [Full Review in Spanish]
Welcome proof that returning to and expanding on a cherished story can still produce invigorating cinema that lives up to the ambition and artistry of the original.
A perfect follow-up film that expands the themes of its predecessor for a new century.
"While it doesn't quite meet the heightened expectations, it's runs on plenty of nostalgia, twists and visuals."
"As the credits rolled, I sat in my seat both physically numb (as I said, cinema seats are unforgiving) and emotionally drained. This is sci-fi cinema at its absolute finest."
"Try to see this amazingly visual and immersive film on the largest screen possible. And yes, it will help to see the original first. The world is beautiful, layered and fascinating and the characters keep you caring every one of its 164 minutes."
Blade Runner 2049 is filled with an unparalleled artistry and is among one of the best looking movies ever to come out of Hollywood.
Blade Runner 2049 is an upgrade in most departments and is an utter joy to watch.
"Blade Runner 2049 is a beautiful, visually stunning film that captures philosophical themes and everything that made 1982's Blade Runner so special."
"For fans of the original, this beautiful masterwork extends the legacy ... Fans of films that are thought-provoking and lingering in both shot and effect, it's a must-see."
"Denis Villeneuve flawlessly builds on the surrealism, mystery, and intrigue that made the original Blade Runner a cult classic."
"Women are aggressively objectified for the male gaze, while people of color are simply erased."
"In the end, Villeneuve's allusion to Nabokov confesses the derivative status of his sequel..."
"Luckily, thanks to Denis Villeneuve's deft direction and an intelligent story, Blade Runner 2049 is not only a worthy sequel, it's an expansion and evolution of the mythology and themes."
"Convincingly well-structured, profound, purposeful and without a prosaic bone in its bountiful body 'Blade Runner 2049′ is stunningly sumptuous Science Fiction theater for the thinking man and for the progressive machinery master-blasters as well."
"Blade Runner 2049 is a movie drenched in frills, crafted with a discerning eye and a work of art that will be long debated years from now."
"With a style so simultaneously reverent of the past and boundary pushing today, the genius of craft behind Blade Runner 2049 truly is its greatest asset."
"Villeneuve has undeniably achieved something grand, making a sequel with insurmountable worth in its own right."
"Villeneuve's masterpiece is an impeccably realised, extraordinary sci-fi neo-noir that will be noted as one of the greatest ever blockbusters."
"Blade Runner 2049 is a worthy successor to the original film, avoiding the mistakes of other recent revivals and bringing just enough new to the table."
"...lays out entirely new waves of questions that will be chewed on and puzzled over in the years and decades to come, assuring that it doesn't just fade away like tears in the rain."
"I don't know that it's a ""masterpiece"" on par with the first one, but it's an entirely solid science fiction feature in its own right with a lot of intriguing ideas at its core."
"Though thematically ambitious and visually unmatched, Blade Runner 2049 isn't the kind of crowd-pleasing blockbuster filmmaking that routinely packs the multiplexes."
"Captivating visuals, a haunting score, and a cast that's uniformly at the top of their game make it more of an experience than a film. It's nothing short of an electric dream."
"Much like the 1982 original, this is a visual marvel - with director Denis Villeneuve meticulously crafting this futuristic world in great detail - although the narrative lacks the same spark."
Any follow-up to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner was going to be an uphill struggle.
"In its first try, Blade Runner 2049 is the movie [Ridley] Scott wanted and audiences have deserved for more than three decades."
"A perfect sequel and, arguably, film in recent memory."
"The world-building here is so intricate, so propulsive. It is almost entirely introspective, the film at times seeming to bob and undulate like an ice floe at sea."
"Perhaps Blade Runner 2049's biggest flaw is style over substance. Check it out for the beautiful look, but be careful diving below the surface."
"It's a stunning movie, it's epic, with an epic soundtrack."
Villeneuve is easily up there with my favorite directors now.
"It's a movie with large spaces that gives us room, both physically and temporally, to let experiences sink in, to enjoy character moments, to worry about danger, and to appreciate nods (large and small) to the earlier film."
"... it's great to see a director and his crew being given the freedom to be eccentric, contemplative, and create a film that doesn't leave you when you exit the dark hall."
"Wallace's desire and K's secret are, of course, connected, because in this gorgeous new Blade Runner, the narrative slots neatly together in a way that's tidy but unsatisfying."
"Directed by Arrival maestro Denis Villeneuve, Blade Runner 2049 is a film that, like all of us-human and replicant alike- actively wrestles with its own existence."
"Blade Runner 2049 is all experience, sound and rain, but that may be fitting for an age defined by artificial living, electric dreams and lonely desires."
"Find you an android lover, curl up to a nice movie."
"It is a startling reminder that even in today's cinema, where CGI spectacles are commonplace, big budget films can produce remarkable works of art."
"Sadly, although the film has all the markings of a great sequel, it lacks any passion or sentiment for most of the story."
"Look elsewhere for your fix, action junkies, and don't judge ""2049"" for what it isn't."
"Small miracles do exist in Blade Runner 2049, but the organic beauty and possibility they represent gets buried beneath ponderous ruminations and plot twists ripped from the pantheon of generic science fiction."
"The failure of ""Blade Runner 2049"" is how it discriminates between men and women, and how that discrimination surpasses the distinction between human and machine. That failure leaves you with no hope for the future."
"As remakes, sequels and reboots continue to plague the art form, it's a pleasure to find one that feels like a labour of love. It's a sincere, interesting and compelling film."
"Denis Villeneuve, the director of Arrival (2016) and Sicario (2015) is undoubtedly an extraordinary storyteller, and the multidimensional tale of the new Blade Runner is no exception. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Gen X was the original audience for Blade Runner, but this film is an insult to it, or maybe just an unnecessary recapitulation of how things are for that generation."
"Baby's first immigrant story and interracial relationship courtesy of … Disney/Pixar? I jest because, honestly, ELEMENTAL is cute and does work on that social level."
An anthropomorphic immigrant romance combines into a mixed metaphorical mess... a Pixar film built on “plussing” instead of being enhanced by it... hoping the rapid fire nonsense will gloss over the lack of cohesion.
"Pixar always had something new up its collective artistic sleeve. And yet here they are, coming out with a film as dull-witted and syrupy as Elemental. "
"Stunning animation sparks this cross-cultural, high-concept 'Romeo & Juliet' romantic comedy, inspired by the periodic chart of elements that one recalls from science class."
Elemental is a marvel of layered animation techniques that float through that uncanny valley between 2D and 3D. It’s hard to discern the physical set pieces from those created in a computer and that lends an edge of realism.
"""Trying to make a character out of a cloud"" is a sadly apt metaphor for this whole doomed endeavor. "
"Together, with the thematic elements and execution of the ideas, ""Elemental"" goes beyond tear-inducing, reaching soul-shaking. Absolutely the surprise film of 2023."
"Water, Fire, Earth, and Air are like ethnic inhabitants of distinctive neighborhoods in this imaginatively designed Element City, with the Periodic Table-like skyline.  But the story line gets heavy-handed about immigrants and accepting different folks."
"Elemental does reward a big screen experience, and its message about love, self-determination, and community is relevant and welcome."
"This Pixar movie doesn’t rekindle the studio’s old magic, but it’s no washout either."
"Visually, the film generally makes up for its dubiously executed premise and underwhelming conflict resolution – it had better, considering the $200 million budget. "
"Elemental is an experience for the big screen for the whole family. It’s dreamy, surreal and magically entertaining without a moment of dullness. Do not miss it for the world."
"The theme of romance between opposite beings is intertwined with the issue of immigration, with which many can identify. [Full review in Spanish]"
The pieces of Elemental go together just like the blending of hydrogen and oxygen to create water. 
"Visually, Elemental is stunning — the way Ember and Wade have been brought to life is an eye-popping intersection of technology and imagination."
"Elemental may be straightforward and predictable, but it's so thematically rich and features such emotionally relatable characters that, by the end, I found myself fighting back tears."
The film's premise is remarkably surface-level and never dives into a more profound meaning beyond apparent comparisons to other Disney-led projects.
"Elemental is a very endearing movie that tackles themes such as generational burdens, parental expectations, honoring legacy but also shows how to create and chasing your own dreams. It’s Pixar first real swing at a romcom, and the love story works. 
"
"Elemental feels like Pixar is taking its titular term to heart in the worst way, making for rudimentary rather than particularly ravishing or resonant viewing.
"
"Elemental has enough depth for adults, creativity for children, and a searing romance that succeeds only when other aspects take a backseat."
"The film’s unconventional romance-comedy-inspired story fails to light the torch of its emotional core, leaving the audience in a state of wanting more."
Elemental is certainly one of those films that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Perhaps it doesn’t have the humor that many would expect from a Pixar film but it does have a thought-provoking storyline.
The choice to present Wade as the catalyst for Ember’s growth devalues her strength and independence.
Elemental is a special kind of animated movie that reminds us why PIXAR is one of the best. A Love story that fills your heart with emotions and your body with joy! Hilarious too! This film speaks volumes on so many themes & knocks them out of the part!
"Nonetheless, the story isn't at the stature of the visuals; it's as if its initial concept doesn't quite live up to its potential and the story remains, as the title, elemental. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The allegories may be heavy-handed, but the adorable central romance is so well done and the visuals are so sumptuous that any shortcomings quickly melt away."
"Elemental is a movie for the whole family as only Pixar knows how to make it: with distinct layers for all ages with a mature, nostalgic, and sad touch for the oldest. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It’s no Toy Story or Nemo, nor does it challenge like Turning Red, but it’s still a reassuring hug of a film. And, for that reason alone, it deserves an audience."
Gentle and humane but never raw or vulnerable.
"It wants to be a reflection on social inequality, but the mocking tone, almost a joke, disengages any hint of criticism or depth. [Full review in Spanish] "
"Elemental has all the hallmarks of a committee-led, box-ticking fiasco."
"It’s all just ‘fine’, and for a studio that has widened the emotional horizons of what animation can achieve, that doesn’t quite cut it."
"A mock of a great Pixar movie, saved by romance. [Full review in Spanish]"
"... The film rallies for a superb tearjerker climax that sends you out on a high and allows you to forget the slightly overcomplicated, rather uneven movie you have just watched."
"It is tough to compete against the past of studio that made its mark from its very first movie, but this is not a forgettable film. Elemental compensates that it does not reinvent the wheel with a lot of heart and emotion. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Doesn’t come close to usurping Sohn's ""The Good Dinosaur"" as the studio’s worst film, but it doesn’t exactly challenge ""Inside Out"" for the top spot, either."
"Ember looks like she isn’t just a plastic figure covered in fire; no, with this animation, Ember is pure fire — and so is the movie surrounding them."
"While much of this could exist as a companion to “Zootopia,” director Peter Sohn shies away from the stereotypes that made that film work. "
"There are tonal parallels with Pixar’s Inside Out and Zootropolis, but while it has a peppy visual energy, Elemental lacks the wildly inventive storytelling of the former and the laughs of the latter."
"despite some charming animation, the movie fizzles where it should pop, weighted by an overstuffed story that works much too hard."
"Obviously there’s wider meaning to this elemental love story, and moments of family-friendly fun."
"But it is clever rather than charming, an animation to admire, not adore. It has all the right elements, in more ways than one. But unlike the greatest Pixar films, it never made my heart sing."
"A bit like Inside Out meets Zootropolis – but not as fully worked out as either – it’s a movie of lovely, radiant moments."
"Beneath the surface of the film is a powerful story about immigration, discrimination and self-acceptance, but it gets lost in the sea of other, lesser plot points. "
"Busy, zany and sincere, the movie does a perfectly good job with the stuff of urban culture clash. But it is also fatally unfunny, and gets more so with every weird contrivance it whips up."
The problem is that there’s not enough storytelling muscle here for the allusion to really land.
"Surely a reality where the elements are in charge should be more inventive, not limited by the trappings of capitalism and gender norms?"
…clued-in enough to make adults and kids think a little about their own potential for prejudice…
There are many parts to Elemental that will entertain and divert; there’s just nothing here that’s particularly memorable.
Shockingly formulaic.
"It’s a civics lesson in search of a story and, sadly, the story it settles on isn’t all that engaging."
"It would be very easy to say that Elemental is too elemental, and we wouldn't be far off the mark, but the sauce used on the familiar dish does add a special flavor. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Elemental is overstuffed and inconsistent — but packed with enough moving sentiment, gorgeous design and punchy voice performances to mean it still burns bright."
"A sweet, charming little rom-com that touches on family, legacy and dreams. Fantastic world design, clever play with the elements and great chemistry between leads. One of the better Pixar offerings in recent memory {Full review in Spanish]"
Elemental feels like a bad ­animated remake of My Big Fat Greek Wedding. 
A movie that encourages kids to be open-minded needed to be laid on our culturally divided doorsteps. Peter Sohn should take a bow.
"While there are problems with the story, the artwork is excellent. There is a lot of visual imagination on display here. While the elements of air and earth get little attention, the elements of water and fire are given lavish attention."
The details of it are really beautiful.
"A good, B+ Pixar movie. All the elements are there for a great film, but they just need some rejiggering, reconfiguring, and trimming. "
"The installment has some funny passages, but in the end it is somewhat bland. [Full review in Spanish]"
"I just hope that ""Elemental"" manages to find its audience, since it is a story worth watching, which strives to connect with the viewer through endearing characters, valuable messages, and a spectacular technical flair.  Full review in Spanish."
Pixar’s first full-blown romantic comedy is lovely. It’s not subtle with its fire and water metaphor for characters from different cultures falling for each other but it’s very heartfelt and sweet.
"Especially coming from a studio that used to be so terrifyingly fastidious about its world-building, the internal logic of Element City is wobbly at best."
Elemental does touchingly delve into the challenges and triumphs of being the child of refugees and growing up immersed in a culturally homogenous community. It shows both the comfort and strength of being around your own people.
"The trailers for Elemental were terrible. Thankfully, the final product is a different story. Elemental feels like classic Pixar. A wonderful world, likable characters, plenty of emotion and enough laughs to keep both young and old audiences entertained. "
"Elemental is your standard Disney/Pixar experience. Crisp animation, punchy writing and poignant moments are all present here. 

Still, Pixar is getting predictable in recent years, and Elemental can feel like an amalgamation of what came before."
"A predictable immigrant tale with a romantic comedy jab. A few too many themes that aren't explored in the deepest ways, but it has its moments and is something fans of Pixar movies can expect to like."
"As slight as it is, I found Elemental to be adorable."
"All the elements look so alive and fluid. With dazzling designs, creative highlights, socio-cultural commentary and meaningful message, “Elemental” elevates itself into a whole other level, a must-watch in breathtaking living color on the big screen.  "
"Watching it, I couldn’t escape the impression that I was seeing something Frankensteined together from other, better Pixar movies. "
If the story had taken a little more chances I think Elemental could have hit that next level. As it is the film works fine for what it is -- the perfect summer escape to the movies for the whole family.
"Would I say that this is a great movie? Honestly, no. However, I’d put this one step under great and say that Elemental is very good."
"PIXAR has done it again, this gorgeous movie teaches lessons of immigrant persistence, roadblocks, and love."
"This candy-coloured new cartoon may be mid-tier Pixar, but even average Pixar projects can be charming."
"Disney’s latest venture Elemental will make your heart melt, even if it’s not Pixar’s best."
"The talented Pixar team, lead by director Peter Sohn, has created a world that's visually stunning and all kinds of fun, with crazy vehicles, creative sports, and clever ethnic/elemental-specific foods, customs and character traits. Maybe that’s enough."
This story is certainly passable. [Full review in Spanish] 
"Elemental combines pertinent social themes with a sweet, funny and masterfully animated romance. [Full review in Spanish]"
This just lacks the creative spark and deep connection of Soul or Turning Red.
"It’s not among the studio’s very best, but “Elemental” is certainly a crowd-pleaser, and proof that Pixar can still deliver even when all the ingredients don’t quite come together."
"A Pixar film that enjoys an original animation on the visual side, but whose entertainment effect evaporates like water in a story of ethnic love and cultural diversity that never ceases to be boring, tepid, and without grace. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It is, not only for the incredible weakness of its central metaphor, the most unsound script that Pixar has ever turned into a feature film."
"While it’s true this isn’t top-tier Pixar, it’s still high-quality family entertainment from a company with an astonishing track record."
"Much of 'Elemental’s essence might be like a plate of home cooking for long-time fans of the studio’s releases. However, as with many of its original stories, this release shows they have more touching things to say once everything comes together."
"Elemental will prove more entertaining for younger audience members, while leaving them with good ideas to consider."
"Thomas Newman’s score in this film is terrific. Naturally, the visuals are as impressive as ever, as well. Those aspects are enough to make the movie good enough, but combining all of these elements still left a bit more to be desired."
"While this might not be a masterclass of narrative originality, it does have an essential truth and humanity at its heart. That goes a long way."
Gorgeous animation. The rom-com aspect was very cute though the emotional connection lies within the story between Ember and her father rather than with Ember and Wade. Certain storylines were left unfinished or without any payoff. 
"Elemental succeeds in telling a story of impossible love, but also a story of immigrants and their dreams, and speaks of tolerance in times of social rifts. [Full review in Spanish]"
"These animators continue to exceed expectations visually. But with a bit more bold truth-telling, and perhaps a less constructed setting, this could have been something much more powerful."
Pixar's strained attempt at cultural segregation struggles to give its characters depth along with metaphors that don't track with the universe's basic safety precautions. It ultimately goes for the heartstrings late but by then my heart just wasn't in it
"It’s so depressing to watch a kids’ movie that leaves you irritated instead of happy, but unfortunately, despite all its visual splendor that’s exactly what “Elemental” does."
"A certain sweet, unworldly idealism in Elemental survives, the keynote of optimism – and this is the flame that Pixar has to keep alive."
Its main strength is in how beautiful looking is the animation.
"Elemental is a lovely, if lightweight, film."
"Elemental is great at juggling its surface love story and its deeper immigrant themes, but, oddly, it only does a passable job at getting all the, ahem, elements to work together across the whole of its runtime"
"Despite all good intentions, Elemental is just not among the studio’s very best. As a family day out at the movies, though, the visuals may be just enough to make it a big-screen experience worth your time."
I left Elemental thinking “why was so much of that about permits...” I shouldn’t be thinking such questions but when the narrative isn’t compelling that’s where the mind goes.
Pixar’s first rom-com proves that a tale as old as time can still spark when told in a refreshingly creative way.
Elemental is Pixar's boldest film yet in delivering a story that offers its own take on immigration and how it impacts relationships.
"This is one of these films that you have to take it at its face value, forget all of the narrative implausibilities, and just enjoy the giant creatures in action and the mythology that the film builds around them."
Not even dull human subplots can take away from the titanic joy one gets witnessing Godzilla and Kong duke it out.
"MUST SEE IN THEATERS. A visual feast that brings to life two of the most iconic monsters in the BEST WAY YET! It’s fast, it’s action packed, & it’s exactly what you expect out of this epic fight night! The last 35 minutes will blow your mind"
"Action-wise, it's the best entry of the saga. From the genuinely impressive, eyegasmic CGI to the exciting, adrenaline-pumping monster fights that will leave you at the edge of your seat, this movie is the definition of pure blockbuster entertainment."
"The showdown itself isn't disappointing and has in store a few ""surprises"" that in spite of being predictable are still enjoyable. [Full review in Spanish]"
Godzilla Vs Kong delivers action and spectacle by the bucket load and will leave anyone who wants to see a giant ape hit a giant lizard in the face with an axe very satisfied.
"It’s 100% geek food, and I was more than happy to fill my plate."
"The script is smart to lay out everything that it needs in three words or less, and this mixture of imaginations and anecdotes gives verisimilitude to its lean yet qualified sci-fi narrative in Great Hollywood fashion. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Leaning into its ludicrous nature was a smart move, delivering exactly what it says on the tin with just enough plot to keep you from looking at your phone."
"Overwritten with a serious lack of even half-interesting ideas, the film feels like far more than a chore than it ever should."
Theres an earnestness and immense amount of fun to be had that the American Godzilla films have severely lacked.
"What's evident throughout Godzilla vs. Kong is that Wingard took care to deliver a distinct and intelligible movie that embraces some out-there ideas in a fun, fast-paced manner."
"...the picture's larger-than-life action sequences, of which there are many, suffer from a heavy use of computer-generated effects that ensure they possess all the weight and reality of a video-game cutscene..."
Much of the movie is senseless and everything that does work ends up being a mere empty spectacle made to satisfy fans. Beyond that it has nothing to offer. [Full Review in Spanish]
"After a year of struggles, there's nothing wrong with a little escapism. Does any of the hollow earth plot make sense on any real scientific level? No, but who cares?"
Perhaps the best of all American Godzilla film - which isn't saying much - this installment at least knows to play with the silly and absurd.
"Considering how bogged-down films of this sort (and by that I mean summer action tentpoles) can get in exposition and backstory, Godzilla vs. Kong moves like a Russ Meyer movie."
Delivers on its alpha rivalry fights. Visually stellar with outstanding sound design. A reaffirmation of the importance of having these blockbuster films.
The four films released thus far in the so-called MonsterVerse ably demonstrate that King Kong still reigns supreme.
"Godzilla vs Kong employs a lot of fine actors doing very obvious paycheck-only work -- nobody is even half as affecting within the entire running time as, say, Juliette Binoche was in a single closeup in the first movie."
"It might be the least pretentious blockbuster we've had in quite a while -- and after a pandemic-starved year without theaters, it's one of the most entertaining, too."
Godzilla vs. Kong lives up to its titanic hype.
"This might be the time for me to tap out of this series, though. The look of most of these films is grim, gray, drizzly."
It's certainly the most quickly paced out of all the MonsterVerse films - for better and worse - but that sprint carries over to the action sequences in a positive way.
"""Godzilla vs Kong"" is epic - epic in size, scope and ambition. Big, loud and brash, it's exactly the type of kaiju film fans of Godzilla and King Kong have been waiting for."
"Everything is big, bigger, and biggest, and while it gets redundant by the end, it is hard not to take pleasure in the sheer outlandishness of the mega-monster smackdowns."
"There's still much to enjoy about this fun, daft, addition to the Monsterverse, and some incredibly silly moments that old school Godzilla fans will adore..."
"A skyscraper-trashing brawl in neon-lit Hong Kong is the action highlight, and a late appearance from another of Godzilla's old adversaries is sure to have fans roaring with delight."
Godzilla vs. Kong is trying to be a great Godzilla vs. Kong movie and it succeeds on that level.
Godzilla vs. Kong is the first of this Western franchise to recognize the kaiju picture as a piece of bold graphic rather than narrative art.
Godzilla vs. Kong delivers just what it promises: a colossal and roaring dose of non-stop action from beginning to end. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Wingard gives the multiple kaiju-on-kaiju battles an emphasis on dynamism and clarity, exploiting differing fighting styles and the body types of Godzilla and Kong to maximum cinematic effect."
There's just something special about these films that I can't deny. They're pure escapism. Plain and simple.
"It sprints through plot and dialogue like it's offended at the suggestion it needs them, and throws only the most basic of foundations together."
has all the peaks and valleys of its predecessors - but it also has some of the craziest large-scale kaiju madness... ever!
"While it makes no sense, there is something very satisfying about watching King Kong punch Godzilla square in the face."
"Director Adam Wingard knows what the audiences came to see. 'Godzilla vs. Kong' has gorgeous visuals, hard-hitting fights, and just enough plot to not overcomplicate the fun."
"[R]idiculously entertaining and endlessly rewatchable, at once funny and joyful yet also grounded and soulful."
"Exactly the blunt, escapist dazzle you need in the middle of a pandemic."
You'll want to take on 'Godzilla vs. Kong.'
...does a fairly solid job pulling the loose threads together into a story about creatures like Godzilla and Kong...and their origins on this planet.
"It seems to me as a dizzy, dull blockbuster, as hollow as a pit in the center of the Earth when it features the showy fight between the fire-breathing lizard and the grumpy gorilla. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A versus film that actually delivers on the VERSUS aspect, it has plenty of flaws but it gave me a good time which is really all I wanted."
it's hard to believe that FIVE writers couldn't come up with a better story. The bottom line is simple: they know the IP is the true star of the film.
"A mindless, fun, crazy thrill ride of epic proportions. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"King Kong vs. Godzilla"" isn't ""intellectual"" but if you're going to lose braincells, there's no better way to do it!"
"Indeed, the monsters encounter many fights; nonetheless, the underwater sea battles and the neon lite streets of Hong Kong's skyscraper scenes rank as standouts."
"It is trying to be fun, but is doing too many things that would only work if the entire thing was more serious. But too much of what's going on is too ridiculous for it to work if the whole thing is going to be treated seriously."
"Its paper thin characters and seriously overstuffed plot don't do it any favors as a film, but as a Godzilla movie it's largely impressive--and delivers on the monster walloping."
"One of the few films that exceed hype. Kudos for getting beyond the early films murkiness, and getting top actors really makes it work. Fantastical and Fun, Go-Go Godzilla!"
Godzilla vs. Kong is a very welcome return to massive blockbuster cinema that delivers on the promise of a battle for the ages with aplomb.
The only thing that saves this are the fight scenes. The cgi was really good. but the human characters were poorly written.
"The storyline was there, the CGI was dope and it was actually fun. It was campy."
"Both Godzilla and Kong deserve a much more grandiose show, but I'm not going to deny that everything related to their fights is fun. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Over-the-top action (and) ludicrous to the max, yet if you expel all your notions of common sense, there's a chance you might enjoy it."
"'...padded or not, Godzilla vs Kong has got the ""Wow!"" factor that hasn't been around since Peter Jackson's reboot...'"
This giant monster showdown - with its slammin' tails and swingin' axes - is one that delivers the goods. But the journey to actually there? That's a different story altogether.
"This entry feels more in line with Kong: Skull Island, its loud, its bombastic and completes the franchise's transition to popcorn tentpole, dropping all the arty pretension of King of Monsters."
Short review: all the stuff where Godzilla and Kong (and other spoilerific kaiju) fight is awesome. Everything else around it is rubbish.
"Godzilla vs. Kong does tick all the right boxes of animation, artistry and larger-than-life characters, which will please all of the fans of this universe, but the writing, directing and acting boxes are empty with the exception of Hottle."
"Oh, just shut up and let the big boys scrap."
"Never are the maneuvers of the battle lost in confusion of bad editing or inexplicably tight framing. It is all there in its indulgent, escapist glory."
"The fights were good. And I was there for the fights, so they delivered on that front."
"Personally, I don't find computer effects quite as compelling as the old Godzilla suit acting or Kong's original stop motion animation. I never feel convinced of the weight of these CGI versions of these creatures."
"The human characters aren't very good and the storytelling isn't very strong, but the monster fights are awesome enough to make up for those glaring shortcomings."
"This movie is an unserious, fanciful, adventurous romp that works as pure escapism. It is proving to be a popular antidote the pandemic blues."
"The enormous effects sequences are the most exciting parts of this film, elaborately overwrought for maximum impact."
"Its final act is a perfectly orchestrated thirty minute face off, which is aimed at blockbuster purists. Epic in ambition and monumentally bombastic in its world building, Godzilla vs. Kong feels designed for cinema."
Godzilla vs Kong hit the kaiju genre hard and succeeds in its use of science fiction and kaiju battles.
"Outrageous, over the top, and wholly spectacular. It delivers on its promise to provide bone-crushing kaiju action, while simultaneously delivering one of the most shamelessly dorky, unapologetically weird studio entertainments in recent memory."
Godzilla deserved better than Godzilla vs. Kong
"Sit down, have some popcorn and enjoy the show."
"I'll almost always respect the movie that knows what it's about over the movie that pretends to be something it's not. In that way, this film is sincere."
"The masterful way in which King Kong vs. Godzilla mixes human comedy with monster mayhem makes it one of my favorites in the long-running Godzilla franchise, an example of everything these movies can be at their no-holds-barred best: a whole lot of fun."
"It's exactly what you think it is, no more no less. It's a shame because there are elements of a more interesting movie here..."
"It certainly delivers on its promise as a massive monster clash, and adrenaline-driven movie lovers will be visually rewarded for catching this spectacle in cinemas."
"It more than unleashes the camp, in a movie unafraid to admit exactly what it is...grand-scale silliness, about the titans of the big screen..."
"It worked for me and I had a really, really fun time with it."
"I didn't dislike the film, it was an exciting jaunt, mostly, but I also, didn't love it. I believe it is possible to have a film of this caliber and visual lushness, that can still have characters conducive to quality and depth. This just isn't it."
"Godzilla vs. Kong is far from a good movie, but it's actually an improvement over the abominable King of the Monsters."
"I thought it was an awesome, action-popcorn flick."
The need to weave an emotional thread throughout the narrative somewhat undermines the blockbuster battles and reduces the anticipated fun.
"It strictly exists to be fun, to be cool, and that's something I can absolutely work with."
Too much of a repeat of all that has gone before. Still exciting to see the Titans clash.
"In the wake of these satisfying battles, the lightness with which the humans are handled isn't a killjoy."
The film looked terrific. There is some imagery here that honestly took my breath away.
It has all the impact of hitting a LEGO tower with a teddy bear.
"Without an engrossing plotline, it's hard to see where the franchise will take us next, but this instalment is the escapist action film we all needed."
"In terms of sheer entertainment, this delivers in spades."
"Unfortunately, Godzilla vs. Kong proves to be the blandest effort yet, both visually and aurally."
"The last half-hour, mind, is quality - even though Wingard doesn't do anything to make the ructions his own."
Creative virtual camerawork showcases the scope of it all in fight sequences that would be leaving packed theaters cheering throughout. I could almost hear the applause.
"It is what it is; a giant monster movie with excellent digital effects, and thrilling, well-choreographed combat [Full review in Spanish]"
A crossover that barely qualifies as a movie. [Full review in spanish].
Director Adam Wingard knows his audience is here to watch these two big monsters tear each other apart. You have to come into this willing to have fun and throw logic and science completely out the window.
"Godzilla vs. Kong is a thoroughly enjoyable, visually stunning action-packed piece of cinema filled with heartwarming moments."
"A distracting jumble that reduces the stakes of the movie's mighty showdown nearly to a vanishing point, and turns the title titans and their other colossal cohorts into the incredible shrinking monsters."
It was the headbutt that hooked me.
...this is such an underwhelming affair...
"Godzilla Vs. Kong is jam packed with hot button notions about big bad corporations and conspiracy theories, but make no mistake, at its giant heart, this is an old-fashioned creature feature."
"Perhaps the intellectual side of the film arrives a little too late after so much action and does not withstand analysis, but it is enough to elevate a genre film born from an enormous What If... [Full review in Spanish]"
"It's basically a fantasy wrapped in the guise of science and used as an excuse for an action thriller, but what a thriller. This is a kinetic explosion at its best with Johansson striding through it with a sense of drive and assuredness..."
"Lucy‘s two strands co-exist, intercut but separate; the pleasure is in ricocheting between two incompatible elements for an entire movie, making those blunt opening juxtapositions surprisingly indicative of what’s to come."
"Besson packs a lot of ideas into the brief 89-minute runtime, but he should've spent another 20 minutes on character development."
Scarlett Johansson rides a kinetic rush of evolutionary sci-fi and brutal action...
"That's right, this is an action film with a higher purpose. It even comes with its own Terrence-Malick-by-way-of-Stanley-Kubrick tribute."
Delves so far into scientific theories and philosophies that it rapidly becomes incomprehensible and downright existentially nonsensical.
The biggest down side for this movie was the huge absence of action sequences.
An immensely entertaining and satisfying film that thrives on the strength of Besson's visual style and Johansson's intelligent and emotionally honest performance.
"While Besson has made a film that looks good and does provide some amount of entertainment, he populated it with a character that sorely lacks a pulse."
"There will be those who laud this as the most fun movie of the summer, while others will condemn it as complete and utter nonsense, and somehow they'll both be right."
"It's silly, it's fun."
"It's like it's the prequel to ""Her."""
A fast and loose action movie hellbent on getting in your face and staying on your mind by any means necessary.
The whole endeavor feels like a half-baked idea carelessly patched together.
"It is confidently dumb, defiantly moronic and a fine way to spend 90 minutes of time before doing something of value."
"I know what you're thinking, but this is no Limitless (Bradley Cooper). As the cells multiply and Lucy taps into more and more of her brain, it's new thrills-new skills with each passing hour."
"Apparently believing the film to be an equally eloquent statement on mankind's past, purpose, and future. It isn't, but with about 50 percent less pretension, LUCY could have been a fun guilty pleasure."
"This undeniably silly, but raucously entertaining, off-the-wall transhumanist actioner is an absolute riot."
"Lucy is not a game-changing science fiction movie. Still, it represents the return of Luc Besson to his baroque and risky approach to genre filmmaking. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Besson may please some with Lucy's visual fireworks and veneer of profundity, but it'll leave most feeling empty inside, hungry for an action flick with real bite."
The film is worth watching for her [Scarlett Johansson] performance alone.
"Lucy might leave you scratching your head, but it's a wild ride."
A bloody fairy tale of a thrill ride that nearly jumps the tracks at every plot turn but ultimately proves to be a lot of fun.
"It's sort of Kill Bill-meets-Gravity, and it's a very entertaining 90 minutes."
"One part Europop art 2001: A Space Odyssey, one part Akira body horror, and one part a variation of Besson's career-long meditation on the Feminine Divine."
Lucy is that rare breed of film that is both pretentious and idiotic.
"Unfortunately, quite quickly, this film goes from a promising sci-fi thriller to a gruesomely brutal action flick."
"When you've got a badass superhero with evil futuristic drug lord enemies, you'd better have a damn good theory about the meaning of existence if we're going to take lots of time out to talk about it. And Lucy doesn't."
"While the whole thing slips by smoothly, and Johansson effortlessly uses both gears in her repertoire, this was probably never going to be anything more than a serviceable rainy Tuesday afternoon film."
Lucy may fail to woo the mainstream audience as it doesn't boast an extravagant budget or thrilling special effects.
"With a little legwork on the fact-checking, Lucy could have been an inventive and exciting piece of science-fiction. As is, however, it's a dumb action movie with a decent performance from Scarlett Johansson..."
"Even as it plumbs the depths of the universe for Johansson, Lucy seems thoughtlessly bound to the least desirable elements of the known world when it comes to its Asian setting and cast."
Do we need repeating? Watch it for the 'breathtaking' VFX and Scarlett Johansson and for 90 minutes of visual delight.
"For a film so centered on mental breakthroughs, this story is nothing innovative."
"In the end, Lucy probably has a good chance of becoming a cult classic along the lines of Videodrome, and that's just fine."
"It's a film that takes great delight in her essentially co-opting a long series of tropes and storylines typically reserved for men in stories of this type, which is an old trope in the feminist action movie wheelhouse."
"let it grab you by the noodle and zap you into its whacked-out vision of human existence. You'll feel much better for it, I promise."
"Throughout it all, Johansson is a cool and calm presence."
"Ms. Scarlett is mad appealing, capable and fierce. Lucy is no more illogical than any superhero movie you've ever seen, and an hour shorter."
"Say what you will about 'Lucy,' which is an absurdly silly and sometimes aggressively stupid movie, but it's at least interested in showing us something new."
"Prof. Norman (Freeman) says we use 10 percent of our brains. Dolphins, at 20 percent, evolved bio-sonar so sophisticated science can't match it. Watch Lucy evolve 100 percent."
"It's an antagonistically unintelligent piece, one that clearly views itself as equal parts entertaining and profound. It's neither."
"A short, fast, violent, outrageously overconfident film full of ludicrous pseudo-science and crazy pop-philosophy."
"As much fun as breathlessly devouring a dime-store pulp novel on a lazy Sunday afternoon, Lucy is a delightfully eccentric addition to the crazy French director's filmography."
"The character Lucy may be all brain, but the film is all heart."
"Is it fair to assume someone may have been USING a massive amount of highly experimental, illegal designer drugs when they came up with this?"
"More interesting as the final panel of the 2013-14 Scarlett Johansson ""what is human?"" triptych than it is in and of itself."
I think the moral of the story is that drugs are awesome. So is Scarlett.
"There's never any tension or suspense to the movie, because whatever Lucy faces, we know her big brain will inexplicably be able to handle it."
"This sci-fi thriller, starring Scarlett Johansson, romps through space and time, thanks to the fast-paced directing style of Luc Besson. Who cares if it doesn't make sense? Can we have another, please?"
"It would be a stretch to call it smart, but 'Lucy' isn't stupid either, and Besson is sensible enough to allow the film to sprint with its idea until starts to get tired, and then stop."
"Faster than the speed of light, Lucy is certainly the best film I've seen this summer."
"Smartly conceived, ""Lucy"" is one of those great ""what if"" films you occasionally stumble across that has you thinking long after it's ended."
Lucy is more of the same mostly nonsensical gibberish we've come to expect from Late Period Besson (TAKEN 2!).
"Built on an erroneous premise, ""Lucy"" is a creative, but hollow film that tries too hard for success."
Besson's most ambitious realization of his peculiarly exuberant notion of girl power.
"Lucy is a barnstorming, breakneck bullsh**fest; a dummy stuffed with pseudoscience. It's also the most entertaining film Besson's made in years."
[A] supremely silly and pleasurable action movie.
"Lucy is just a film that takes an intriguing (albeit absurd) narrative, and builds a world around it that is easy to get lost within."
A fast-paced sci-fi thriller that combines action-packed set-pieces with philosophical looks at the nature of humanity.
Luc Besson gleefully combines two of his favourite movie elements - fit women and wildly insane action - in this raucous guilty pleasure.
Rollickingly entertaining - up to a point.
"A dizzyingly silly, extravagantly enjoyable sci-fi thriller."
"Lucy is a brash, breezy and breathlessly paced thriller, with a high-concept plot that falls apart the moment you start thinking about it. But Besson's camera moves so fast that you rarely get the chance."
It would be overstating it to suggest that Besson is enjoying a major creative renaissance but Lucy is the best film he has made in a very long time.
The movie's title character may find her brainpower increasing as the running time counts down; chances are you'll feel like your own IQ levels are dropping just as rapidly as you watch it.
"In this pile of adolescent heavy-metal-deep pseudo-sci-fi philosophy, the meaning of humanity (or lack thereof) depends on how ""cool"" something looks onscreen."
Lucy is a stupendously effective exercise in high-end misdirection.
French writer/director Luc Besson has created a cottage industry of female action heroines with big guns and small skirts.
Besson is a keen pilferer of anything that's looked good in other people's movies.
"It's barmy but there are enough enthralling moments in which action clichs (fights, car chases) are turned on their head, to often breathtaking visual effect."
"Besson is at his balls-out bonkers best in this genre-scrambling, mind-expanding exhilarator. Find it on the biggest screen available and just say 'Yes'..."
"Those expecting a straight-ahead action movie in Luc Besson's ""Lucy"" may find this sci-fi head-scratcher a little crazy - but I don't think it's crazy enough."
"To the degree that Lucy's adventure is even temporarily plausible, let alone engaging, it's because Johansson makes it so."
Ridiculous stuff mostly but entertaining and Johansson is terrific.
"To its credit, Lucy doesn't shy away from making its main character inhuman."
Makes The Fifth Element look like 2001 by comparison.
"Who remembers the last good Luc Besson movie? Time to reset that particular clock, as he's returned with a stormer."
Its sputtering eccentricity is at least preferable to the flat chauvinism of so many shoot-'em-ups - and it's certainly Besson's most enjoyable bad movie in ages.
Lucy is not about to win any prizes from Mensa ... but this isn't quite like any other blockbuster you'll see this year.
"Besson is audacious, bending time and space at [Lucy's] will with comic effect - in the sense that it's funny and reminiscent of a kitsch cartoon strip - only pausing briefly every now and then for a bit of philosophical musing."
It seems Besson has been saving up all his Frenchness for this - the most pretentious B-movie of all time.
Lucy is immensely inconsistent and exceedingly daft and yet it remains a good deal of fun.
"For most of its short running time this is sincerely, watchably and gloriously crackers."
What begins as a thrilling pastiche of comic-book formula gets bogged down in its own scientific prattle - not that you ever stop adoring Johansson's magnificent heroine.
"Besson reminds us how limber he can be...The material is always cheeky in its sense of humor and stylistic and cultural allusions...and frequently, if not fundamentally, provocative..."
"If this represents just 10% of Luc Besson's creative potency, the mind boggles at what he could achieve at full capacity."
Science-fiction lunacy
"Here, at last, is a film based on the Kantian model of transcendental idealism."
"Lucy is pretty silly, but it trots out varied philosophical and metaphysical themes. This is the kind of thing that often spawns mini-cults in rentals."
Besson has taken a silly concept and elevated it to a level that can best be described as insane poetry.
"No-one shoots a Parisian car chase like Besson, and he's capable of a garishly vulgar set piece; the set-up of the movie - the opening twenty or so minutes - is quite excellent. It's total EuroTrash, but with a Scarlett sheen."
"While the story is concisely and confidently told, there's something chilly about Lucy (and Johansson's) sudden goodbye to life as we know it."
"Johansson, a good actress, succeeds in making this nonsense more believable than it otherwise might be."
"After a decade of uncertain performances in often thankless roles, Scarlett Johansson is interesting again. She seems to have found her niche in science fiction: Luc Besson's Lucy is the third film in a row - after Her and Under The Skin."
"Luc Besson's grasp cannot sustain his out of this world vision of creating an action movie that is as revolutionary in its ideas as it's stimulating in its visuals, resulting in a muddled mess of both."
"When it's done you're a little groggy and resent yourself a bit. But its absurdly slick, wholly surface-level appeal is hard to deny."
Another sci-fi film that eschews the science for too much fiction.
"It's so easy to pick apart the gaping the plot-holes and scientific flaws in Luc Besson's latest flight of fancy, Lucy. But to get mired down in such details would be to miss out on a whole lot of fun."
Director and co-writer Kurtis David Harder (“Summerland”) creates a lush and gorgeous film that will make his audience want to jump into the screen and join the characters regardless of the looming danger. 
A captivating central performance does its best to elevate this otherwise serviceable social media horror.
"A smart, savvy thriller anchored by star Cassandra Naud's magnetic performance. The way the film uses her natural birthmark is particularly innovative, as are the multiple shifts in perspective that help to keep the story fresh."
"There’s a lot to love about Influencer, however that just makes its flaws all the more frustrating."
A horrific reality check for those lost in the monetised sauce of the internet’s digital fakery.
"Where’s she from? What’s that giant chip on her shoulder? Harder and Tesh Guttikonda’s script can’t be bothered—beyond giving her a large facial birthmark that presumably “explains” why she hates all these globetrotting, selfie-taking pretty people."
It zigged everytime I thought it would zag.
"Influencer is a meticulously crafted, gripping mystery sure to keep audiences guessing. "
"Influencer is a nice mix of psychological thrillers like Single White Female and Hand That Rocks the Cradle, with a modern social media spin. Cassandra Naud delivers a compelling performance, despite wanting a little more from the character. "
"[It's] a tense, fun little thriller that takes some unexpected turns."
"More than anything, Influencer is just fun, primarily for the strong performances but also for the beautiful locations and general disdain for influencers of all kinds. They may not deserve to die, but they still suck."
"Just when you think you know where Influencer is going, it pulls a switcheroo, playing into tropes (yes, there is a ""no cell service"" moment) while also setting you on edge..."
What awaits you is a mystery in a beautiful landscape sprinkled with some intense kills and anxiety-inducing scenarios.
"Influencer isn’t likely to make anyone want to become a vlogger or go on an exotic vacation, but it holds our attention and keeps us guessing throughout."
" Influencer has very good acting in each of the roles, even if most of the characters lack a certain depth that would make the story and conflicts that much better. "
Influencer is a compelling drama with real-world horror that keeps you hooked. 
"Thriller flirts with boredom before ramping up for a taught, and shocking finale."
"Predictability is most unfortunate about Influencer, as the film attempts to live up to its thriller status but ends up spoon-feeding the audience and telegraphing every “twist.” "
"Set around social media, Influencer serves as a fun thriller. While it has little new to say about its core subject, it expertly homages iconic works."
"A strong, noteworthy turn by Cassandra Naud is not enough to distract from what feels more like a rug-pulling exercise than a real tale of suspense or commentary on isolation or the central occupation of the title."
"From here Influencer delivers a rock solid Hitchcockian thriller against the picturesque backdrop of Thailand that toys with expectations up until its final moments. Like Psycho, it’s hard to know what’s coming after the film’s opening credits."
"If you want to see a really tightly constructed thriller with some really cool curveballs in it, this is excellent stuff."
"With sharp dialogue, skillful plotting and simmering dread, Influencer is plenty worthy of that “Like” button."
Full-blooded when it needs to be... but its focus is on mutable storytelling and its atmosphere of nebulous menace
"Eerie and disturbing, this cautionary tale of self awareness has some solid thrills."
"Influencer perfectly captures a moment in time. Ten years from this date, we’ll be vastly unsettled by something else; Kurtis David Harder’s film captures terrors which are only possible, like this, right now."
"[Influencer] is smartly crafted, well-written, and strongly performed."
"On a surface level, this is an alluring film, all about what happens when people bring their carefully constructed online personas into the messier, bloodier real world."
"If you can just go with the flow, “Influencer” may not convince you that’s an occupation with a future, but it will still have you on the edge of your seat to the very end."
"Though it doesn't fully stick the landing, losing sight of its most compelling character along the way, its authentically creepy contortions makes it entertaining as hell to see it fly."
"The result is a well-executed thriller wherein we’re allowed to check our compassion at the door. There's no one to therefore root for, so we bask in the potential carnage to see who (if anyone) escapes alive."
"Director and co-writer Kurtis David Harder relies on that influence to toy with the audience, too, in a thrilling and clever way that makes Influencer fascinating to watch."
"Beyond the plotting and scheming, Harder also plays a neat game with sympathy in this story."
"Influencer's messages land with a softer impact, but that doesn’t prevent its twisty predatory narrative from snagging our attention like a buzzworthy viral sensation."
[Influencer] constantly subverts expectations with a plot that darts in unforeseen directions. 
"Harder has made good and entertaining use of a premise that could have become a simple gimmick, and Naud and Saper prove strong leads as their characters try to read each other between the likes."
[A] smartly arranged thriller...
Influencer confounded me countless times and it sticks landing oh so well. It also has something potent to say about social media.
"Offers a chilling look at our natural insecurities, arrogance, and conceit when it comes to our online presence, but it also is a really fun horror-thriller that’s exceptionally satisfying."
"""Influencer"" is a tight, tense, contemporary thriller that doesn't reinvent the wheel, but still delivers a solid entry into the genre. "
"A suspenseful, and absolutely stellar dark thriller..."
"Naud does a fantastic job with the material she is provided and is the best part of Influencer. From her sinister stares to her subtly manipulative manner, she controls the scene every time she is on screen. 

"
"It slightly wobbles in the second act and some of the characters feel a tad shallow, but the finale is more than satisfying.  "
Probes the disparity between online facades and authentic living while masterfully unravelling exciting twists through brilliant performances that enrich the narrative.
"Influencer is able to cut through competition by delivering compelling visuals, tantalising arcs and villainous commentary. A thrilling ride in what makes us human, perfect and unhinged."
This is a brutal and incisive look at social media addiction but the scariest thing about Influencer might just be how it reflects our own online obsession back at us.
Influencer feels like there was a good idea somewhere that got rushed along the way. I don’t know what the original idea was but this movie is as shallow as it paints its characters to be.
"Cassandra Naud gives a hypnotic performance and, combined with the rest of the cast and unexpected turns, makes Influencer an entertaining cautionary tale."
"A zippy sun-soaked thriller that rewards the viewer with its spellbinding blend of glitz, glamour, and mystery. "
Influencer becomes this canny and morally slippery exploration of what objectification means and how it functions in our culture.
"Kurtis David Harder’s taut Thailand-set thriller follows the anxiety, emptiness and increasing isolation of online celebrity"
Charlotte Wells’ stunning debut is a quiet rumination of the lost daughter.
Charlotte Wells’ picture-perfect debut visually epitomizes the heart-wrenching processes of memory.
Director Charlotte Wells gives us one of the most piercing debuts in recent memory with this intimate dad-daughter relationship drama.
"Shimmering like a mirage that retreats and dematerializes the closer one gets, Aftersun may just be the best movie of 2022."
Aftersun is so interesting in the way it explores the reality of parents that they keep their children in the dark about.
"Aftersun is left open-ended, and that’s a perfect conclusion to this portrait of a father and daughter relationship. It speaks to the inability of a child to truly understand their parents, no matter how valiantly they try."
"'Aftersun' depicts an unvarnished portrait of a young man grappling with responsibilities, struggling to hold on to his own life while willingly shouldering responsibility of another. 

"
"Aftersun is a tour de force for its two leads, a phenomenal child performance from Frankie Corio with Paul Mescal cementing himself as one of the best actors of his generation and showcasing incredible range"
"In addition, there’s a dark side to all of this; you begin to remember the darkest of memories – the ones you try to avoid..."
"The Scottish director is not only beautifully attuned to the most minor nuances of human sensitivities, but also capable of translating this natural inclination through a refined command over form."
"Without being an overtly dramatic or narrative lesson, Aftersun sticks a finger into the wound and digs into the most intimate to devastating effect. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The film is small, discreet, intimate, a little coy—at times, a bit self-involved and inward-turning. The somewhat self-conscious insistence on the lack of great drama can be tedious at times."
"The easy pace of Wells’s direction brings out the best in her central performers, and the chemistry between Mescal and Corio plays out effortlessly. The light moments between them are warm and the darker ones linger heavily."
"A quiet, emotionally unmooring portrait of father and daughter in moments of blissful silliness and small confessions... it’s a devastatingly honest rendition of the aftershocks of a parent’s love when we realise, too late, the simple joys we shared."
Wells shows how interactions that were solid within their own moment become more ambiguous as time has gone by and the adult understanding of Sophie has grown.
Charlotte Wells’s self-assured debut takes pains to be specific to its time and place.
"A subtlety—a nuanced exposition of storylines that might have easily been too simplified—that one doesn’t often find in larger films, particularly American ones..."
"The role calls for the sensitivity of the budding artist, the impishness of childhood, the yearning of adolescence, security and sudden insecurity, the unspoken intimacy of parent and child. Corio is marvelous."
"For a movie that initially seemed slight upon first glance, this has haunted me like few other films from 2022."
Aftersun can be momentarily cathartic in making us confront the troubling ghosts of our past that tend to define our present. But it doesn't offer the false promise of healing in the future. 
"By embracing the polysemous instead of rushing to define her lead character, Wells has given us a feature that exists somewhere between capital-Q queer cinema and a more lowercase approach."
"Aftersun is a stealthy movie because even as it lulls you into a state where you’re wondering just what is the point of the whole endeavour, it has already successfully gripped you with its unsentimental heart."
"It’s a very personal piece and much about it is more mystifying than revelatory. Still, the leads are magnificent together. If nothing else, Aftersun will make you think about your relationship with your own father."
"Dreamy, deft and light on detail, this elusive tale of memory and loss has a playful summer-holiday home movie look and a compelling emotional resonance"
"Sadness is an all-pervasive threat in a paradoxically lovely debut from writer-director Charlotte Wells, based in part on her life.
"
"While Wells demonstrates a delicate and apparently very personal talent – she has said in interviews that her film is emotionally autobiographical – she will in the future, I hope, move on to more substantial material than this wafer-thin story."
"Mescal gets a tilt at Hollywood's night of nights for his efforts, but Corio is just as extraordinary — perhaps more so given that it's her first acting role. Watching the duo together is a marvel."
A perfect film.
"Somehow, without its effects becoming obvious, Wells brings us to the gravity of what she is remembering. The accumulation of small details builds a strong sense of who these characters are."
"Aftersun is a bright, funny, immensely likeable and touching film."
"Writer-director Charlotte Wells brings a lightness of touch to just about every element of this film. The relationship between father and daughter feels utterly real, sometimes at cross purposes, sometimes bored, sometimes as close as two people can be"
"[There] are gaps in Aftersun that are left to the audience. [… Charlotte] Wells has a keen eye for detail and feelings, one she uses to build moment upon moment into a towering emotional crescendo."
"The Situationists and the Sex Pistols may have had nothing good to say about cheap holidays in other people’s misery, but Wells finds a wealth of beauty and heartache in this one."
"Events play out at an unhurried pace, but the film certainly leaves a lasting emotional impression."
"Delicate and not rushed, the full brunt of this film’s impact didn’t strike me. However, the final scene does wrap a deft bow around the lingering mystery."
A tremendous film. Something that looks at a hard topic like depression in a very beautiful and human way. 
"It’s not just a wrenching family drama but a fascinating meditation on memory, the poignant dance between past and present, and the experience of looking back on childhood with the perspective of an adult, seeing things we didn’t notice before."
What works tremendously in favour of Aftersun is the extent to which screenwriter-director Charlotte Wells is able to trust her audience to fill in the details.
"It combines the worst elements of a slow-moving art film and a found footage film. While there is clever camera work in the film, especially in the last scene, I found the visual elements of the film to be too repetitive and not illuminating enough."
"The delicate portrayal of how social and financial pressures impact the children of those at the sharp end of them, is what ultimately makes Aftersun so haunting and difficult to forget."
Charlotte Wells has produced something that will have us talking for years and years to come.
A hypnotic and mesmerizing quiet slice of life.
"Wells is masterfully using the cinema form for a powerful, intimate discourse on memory and connection, as profound as Hirokazu Koreeda's 'After Life,' but subtler. It's a beautiful achievement, worthy of many viewings."
"Aftersun is a ripe, sensitive and slightly mysterious drama film served by great actors and crystallized by a rigorous staging and a deeper sense of observation."
"This father-daughter drama is a lyrical, impressionistic childhood reminiscence that weaves past and present to create the textured experience of memory."
"Aftersun is a sharply drawn memoir that captures moments of happiness shared by a father and daughter, a time that will be replayed in the mind for years to come."
Aftersun is an acquired taste for those who like to watch raw dramatic emotions.
"Aftersun takes a fond look at parenthood, but doesn't hide the inherently hard moments of life. [Full review in Spanish] "
"Well acted and respectable for its heart, but the structure of the story and narrative feels too laissez-faire for my tastes."
"Aftersun is a film about belonging, aching loss, and making memories, and you will find yourself taking deep dives into personal pools of these elements, looking for your share of the sun."
Steven Spielberg mustered the courage to confront his childhood trauma only five decades into his career (and after the perpetrators of it had both passed). Charlotte Wells has achieved something just as majestic with her first movie.
"Aftersun's warmth is so all-encompassing, it takes a while for the underlying sadness to make its presence felt. In this wistful, ultimately wrenching film, time slows down and speeds up. The biggest tragedy, however, is that it doesn't stand still."
"The fact that this is Charlotte Wells’ feature film writing and directorial debut is stunning. Her vision is laid out meticulously, is so well-paced, and it has one of the absolute best final scenes/images of the year."
"The pathos in Aftersun is staggering. From the opening frame, there's a lingering emotional ambiance that suggest something meaningful is about to take place. And it very much does."
"A poetic, contemplative, elegant film with a heartbreaking story of the strong bond between a father and his daughter, this one packs quite the emotional punch.  "
"Anchored by two outstanding lead performances, “Aftersun” snatches the past, turning a faded Polaroid into a tangible web of contentment and the inexorable ache of loss."
"An ordinary film would lead toward an explosive ending, but despite the mounting tension there is nothing plot-driven about this subtle, piercing, small wonder of a film..."
"Things are sunny on the surface, but a melancholy truth lies beneath, obscured through Sophie’s young eyes. When it finally bubbles to the surface, it packs a heartbreaking punch."
" More evocatively, the film reflects on the things we never truly know about our own lives, and about the people we have loved and thought we knew so well."
"Undeniably an inspiring watch, but it's almost inevitable to walk out with emotional wounds and an empty feeling in your soul. [Full review in Spanish]"
Aftersun maintains the airs of an ephemeral memory – a fleeting moment in time that simultaneously feels incredibly vivid yet hauntingly undefined.
"At worst, Aftersun will be the stunning piece we look back on in twenty years, knowing it was the announcement of special stars."
Paul Mescal and Frankie Corio are mesmerizing in this unforgettable story about the infinite power of memories. [Full Review in Spanish]
An adult's emotional introspection; she recalls strong childhood memories to give them a more profound and serene interpretation. [Full review in Spanish]
Aftersun is a beautiful study of how the nature of our memories changes as our time on Earth expands our ability to see the reality of one another. [Full review in Portuguese]
"Leaving much to speculation, Aftersun doesn’t promise any more than it can really offer, keeping its proceedings at a watchful distance even at the points where it seems most obliged to share and give."
"Beneath the luminous surface of a summer film, one of the most devastating movies of the season emerges. [Full review in Spanish]"
It doesn't have much plot but the 2 lead performances are very likable and sweet and you find yourself rooting for this pair.
A film about paternal estrangement that goes much further than that. [Full review in Spanish]
"Nostalgia through memories. ""Aftersun"" is one of the few movies that have been able to convey those sensations, those images that make up our childhood memories. In fact, it's that quality that gives the film its dreamlike tone. Full review in Spanish."
Each viewer who sees “Aftersun” will have a moment where it all clicks into place. And that moment won’t be the same moment for the person sitting next to you. 
"It’s strangely moving, and a joyous examination of a father/daughter relationship, but it’s ultimately too ambiguous and ephemeral to be game-changing."
It’s a complex and affecting drama about the vagaries of memory and the uncertainties of family dynamics.
"Wells leaves the details unspoken via a formally fluid, sensorial experience. All we really know for certain is that their love for each other was undeniable—Mescal (unforgettably vulnerable) and Corio's performances ensure it."
"Wells’ use of visual texture doesn’t just help capture her story. It resonates through that story in all directions, echoing through the medium itself, as if to turn the camera back on the nature of images, and the way we perceive them. "
A notable study about broken dreams and sundered futures. [Full review in Spanish]
Beautiful and small and enormous.
"First time writer-director Charlotte Wells very nearly did an excellent job with “Aftersun,” but she didn’t trust herself to get her point across, and overdoes it so badly the whole movie spoils."
"Told with such delicacy, such empathy, that it’s impossible to leave it unchanged, ""Aftersun"" is bruising in effect, haunting in what it leaves us shouldering. "
"Aftersun will be a movie memory to ruminate on and revisit for years to come, a perfect, personal film. "
"What Charlotte Wells achieves is curious, strange, and welcome..."
Charlotte Wells’ debut is a memorable one... The soft touch of idealism meets the hard grasp of reality in a tight and unrelenting grip. Mescal is quite terrific.
"Wells captures with her images, truthful and painful, certain and elusive, an ambiguous atmosphere of enjoyment and melancholy. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Brief, emotionally-rich moments are sandwiched between such nothingness that it’s difficult to care beyond a basic humanist level."
"First-time director Charlotte Wells memorializes the singular, unreal and entirely fleeting feeling of a vacation bond shared with one’s irregular guardian."
"An emotional, striking feature debut ... Aftersun surprises with an understated, emotionally complex and nuanced portrait of the hidden, unexpressed needs of a parent ... Aftersun has unearthed an acting delight in Corio"
"Wells knows exactly what she’s doing, and her storytelling is as precise as it is piercing."
"Wells’ direction is remarkable in its confidence and clarity. Aftersun is a visual marvel; it recreates those slightly crappy childhood holidays with precision and care, affection even. "
"Wells' ability to capture the innocence of her past self, from a more mature and grown-up point of view is what makes her film into such an unusual piece of filmmaking."
Writer-director Charlotte Wells's feature debut Aftersun is a sublime example of how an opaque style can be wedded to an ambiguous storytelling technique without cost to psychological truth. 
"Aftersun is a little gem -- restrained, subtle, sweetly melancholic, and the interplay between Mescal and Corio has the unerring ring of truth."
"There is so much going on in Aftersun that I might have to watch it again, and you know what? It will surely break my heart a second time."
"For all that Aftersun can be described as gentle, contemplative and even beautiful, it’s also the kind of film that feels as if it’s teetering on the edge of a cliff. "
Aftersun excels at capturing the little moments that come to mean so much when we look back on our lives. It also makes us appreciate them even more.
The power of the film is that it lives so firmly within the ambiguity of parental feelings. 
This is an experience you won’t forget in a hurry.
"For some, Aftersun may simply not land. But those of us who love it will find ourselves in Sophie's situation, unable to dispel its final images from our memory."
"I had my top-five-movies-of-the-year list all sorted. Now - boom! - I’ve had to start from scratch. Damn you, Mescal, for being the cornerstone of something so beautiful."
One of the most beautiful and affecting films I have seen this year.
"…an auspicious debut, largely through Wells’ ability to get sensitive, natural performances from her leads, and through the fresh photography of Gregory Oke…"
"The helmers strike gold with this documentary, which supplies a necessary overview of creative decisions and hirings that led what was meant to celebrate all things “Star Wars” to the television hall of shame."
"There's no defending the half-witted, scruffy-looking TV show that aired only once, but this new movie gives the bomb some affection while putting it in context."
"Fun—and probably less traumatizing than watching the real thing, which can be found pretty easily on free online sites."
A shallow dive into the wackadoodle program that just barely justifies its existence.
"A Disturbance in the Force shares one notable thing in common with its subject: both are largely unnecessary, but also fairly amusing. "
"With time and a little bit of understanding, maybe we shouldn't be so hard on [Star Wars Holiday Special] anymore. "
"Coon and Kozak ensure that the creators get their due. This is not a documentary that punches down, even when it's at its most ridiculous. Instead, it invites the creative team to laugh along and still earn their laudits."
"Star Wars fans will absolutely appreciate this, but whilst it is well made and seasoned with real passion, it can’t escape the fact it is merely a surface-level look at one of the most bonkers of pop culture phenomenons."
A Disturbance in the Force feels totally miraculous 
 A Disturbance In The Force is a comprehensive and hilarious document that’s a must see for all Star Wars fans –  those have seen The Holiday Special and those who have tried to sit through it.
Coon and Kozak show that The Star Wars Holiday Special truly exists on an island alone as an unwitting cautionary tale never to be repeated again.
A very entertaining documentary that caters to the casually committed Star Wars fan. 
"Full of interesting nuggets of information, there is plenty in A Disturbance in the Force that will delight casual and hardcore fans alike."
The special itself may exert a certain fascination but this documentary reveals that there was much more going on behind the scenes.
This is the kind of movie where you hang on every word because the interview subjects have such juicy things to say.
A really entertaining doc where the filmmakers smartly take the opportunity to not just take more easy shots at the Star Wars Holiday Special but make the case that it actually fit very neatly into the oddity of 1970s variety shows
"The special was a super-sized version of the action figures, the commercials--the whole George Lucas-generated shebang. Awful, sure, but as co-directors Jeremy Coon and Steve Kozak persuasively prove: it was also inevitable."
"Even the most diehard fans may learn something new. If nothing else, it’s a rare gem that sincerely believes there’s something to be mined from failure, including joy."
"This documentary, which must be seen if you are a true fan of all that takes place in that faraway galaxy, is about what led to this very special mess and flop."
"The phrase “good movie” & “Star Wars Holiday Special” are not regularly in the same sentence, but there’s a first time for everything. Here goes: A Disturbance in the Force, a new documentary about The Star Wars Holiday Special, is in fact a good movie.

"
"This movie remembers a time when the world was fuller because Star Wars was so lame, it was kind of cool."
"Made for the fans of the franchise, A Disturbance in the Force is a time capsule that exists so that the fandom won't ever let Lucasfilm forget about the ""Holiday Special."" "
"A Disturbance in the Force ends up being a celebration of Star Wars and its history, even in its weirdest forms"
"Even as A Disturbance in the Force isn’t remarkable filmmaking, it is of true value because of the extraordinary number of clips from variety shows of the era. That’s where Kozak especially shines."
"What ""Disturbance"" arguably does best... [is] the way it maps a transitional moment between old showbiz razzle-dazzle and New Hollywood blockbuster entertainment. "
"Maybe it really wasn’t all that terrible. Or maybe it was. Either way, the tone is more affectionate than disparaging in Jeremy Coons and Steve Kozak’s documentary."
"Playful in tone and absolutely stacked with sources who either worked on or spent their youth obsessed with the special, the doc will entertain devoted and casual Star Wars fans alike."
This is the story of a time when having the biggest movie of all time didn't guarantee lasting cultural impact.
"When it isn’t poking fun at moments of iconic trash, it offers an insightful exploration of the production and context of the special."
A Disturbance in the Force is the Star Wars Holiday Special documentary that Star Wars fans have been waiting years to watch.
"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves isn’t just one of the best films of 2023, it’s one of the best fantasy films in decades."
"It has dungeons, dragons, magnificent castles, evil wizards, close-call adventures and more; it takes you right where you want to go, but with a teeny bit extra... like the extra toffee you get from your grandma."
"D&D is a delight that even those unfamiliar with the game will enjoy immensely. It's packed with enough action, laughs, and heart to entertain any family whose parents aren't still mired in a Satanic panic mindset."
"“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” is an unexpectedly delightful, lighthearted, enchanting adventure. At its heart, the film encourages reluctant heroes to fight for fairness, equality, and justice. "
"A pleasant surprise. A great mixture of world building , humor, & action to make this one of the most entertain movies of the year."
"Writer and director duo John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (“Spider-Man: Homecoming”) and cowriter Michael Gilio execute well-worn tropes and platitudes in a lighthearted, heartwarming, satisfying way. "
"I went in with low-expectations, but was thoroughly charmed, partly because of the performances of Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, and Hugh Grant. "
Directors Jonathan M. Goldstein and John Francis Daley have used a balance of big action sequences with a continuous barrage of one-liners and sight gags to come up with a fun film.
"Buckets of fun, with great performances and genuine laugh-out loud moments...there may be audiences rooting around for substance but similar a D&D game, they should just roll with it and enjoy themselves."
Chris Pine is the MVP of an incredibly charming cast with such natural chemistry that the comedic moments become truly hilarious - the graveyard scene will be replayed over and over again.
"A feast for the eyes, “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” excels in not taking itself too seriously but allowing viewers to enjoy a fun experience. "
Brought back memories of my childhood when I would run around the playground and pretend I was a knight will all of my friends. A laugh out loud love letter to all geeks and nerds out there. The entire cast is great but Rodriguez steals the entire show!
"It marks the return of the kind of blockbuster that rarely graces the silver screen today, one that grounds its awe-inspiring spectacle in sincerity and character. "
"In essence, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a crowdpleaser in the best of ways, resuscitating overplayed tropes with the right amount of thrills, humor, and heart.

"
"The comedic route may not sit well with those expecting anything D&D related to be consistently serious. Yet, anyone who’s ever played a game, imaginary or video based, will know humor is as crucial to the whole experience as sheer skill."
"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a perfectly imperfect movie made for the fans. It is an undeniable hoot and a half that, apart from the odd Owl Bear, will please most tabletop role-players."
"With just the right mix of action, fantasy and humor delivered by characters that are impossible not to fall in love with it is easy to see why many cinema lovers will be calling for a sequel to be made as soon as possible."
"The usual problem with adapting games into film is that there’s not enough plot to hang a story on (I’m looking at you, Angry Birds.) D&D is nothing but stories. Honor Among Thieves feels like something a dungeon master would cook up for a campaign."
"""We're gonna make this fun.""
""Oh, but what's the added depth?""
""No, no, no, shut up. Fun!""
I fell like we don't get that all that much anymore."
"A generic adventure film that tries to wink so hard with its goofy, and mostly unfunny, quipping and then still tries to sell us on its more sincere moments when it is not namedropping objects as cameos."
"Captures just the right blend of humor, thrills, fantasy, and lovable characters, and brisk storytelling, approximating the fun of a bunch of good pals playing the game."
"From Pine’s delightful performance to the consistently effective humor, there’s little about D&D that doesn’t charm."
"If you’ve been missing the sort of broadly sincere action-fantasy films we used to get in the Eighties, Honor Among Thieves is chaotic good."
"Grant has a knack for portraying charming yet evil villains, and Forge is no exception."
"Just like Goldstein and Daley found a way to transform a kidnapping story into one of the best comedies of 2018, as well as the decade, so have they made [D&D] something that cues tabletop newbs like myself to be excited to see what comes next. "
It’s not very funny and the whole meandering plot just felt kind of boring.
A great time at the movies.
Lavishly produced.
"In a film world full of geek culture adaptations, Daley and Goldstein’s 2023 adaptation is the functional and rewarding film that Dungeons & Dragons fans have long awaited."
"...takes its fantasy world seriously, but not itself."
"It’s popcorn japery in fine form: Swords against sorcery, sorcery against monsters, monsters against swords, and around and around, while the charismatic cast slam-bangs the consistently amusing setup/one-liner dialogue..."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a great representation of how players imagine the games in their private spaces playing out.
"Just like the game, the movie leaves you wanting more adventures, whether it's from this same cast or others in this world. It’s about time we got to see the magic of D&D on the big screen!

"
"Goldstein and Daley keep the jokes and the action running in tandem, and add just enough emotional weight — like Edgin’s concern for his daughter — to make it all not seem too frivolous."
"If you didn’t know how to play Dungeons and Dragons before seeing the movie (subtitled “Honor Among Thieves”), you won’t after seeing it, either. But you can say you were entertained.

"
"Ultimately, a big-hearted crowd-pleaser."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves builds towards a typically exhausting climax that ensures it finishes on just about as underwhelming and interminable a note as one could possibly envision...
"The story of a motley crew who dares to defeat a dangerous big bad is entertaining and likable, and worth watching not only for RPG fans. [Full review in Spanish]"
"In Honour Among Thieves, odd moments of sincerity largely crumble in the face of amusement and outlandishness [...] It is by tapping into the very soul of Dungeons and Dragons that this film manages to stand proud as a worthy namesake."
"Brings the game to life with a scent of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."""
"It’s all good fun, never makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously, and Hugh Grant does a fine line in oily baddies."
"If you are looking for a fun movie to go watch this weekend that has great action, but isn’t too violent, and contains a lot of fun, then Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is definitely a must-see."
It’s as though Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves made a smoothie with Spaceballs and The Avengers to a side-splitting effect. 
"A big-budget crowd-pleaser, it is well-cast, well-crafted and just plain fun, an old-school spectacle that makes a compelling case for sitting in the dark with a hundred or more strangers and just enjoying the show."
It'll leave you wanting more. We deserve more!
"Dungeons And Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a crowd pleasing, infinitely enjoyable and super FUN movie that never feels distant, heavy or inaccessible. Chris Pine provides a much needed wink and charm while Michelle Rodriguez kicks much ass in this one.
"
"Silly, swaggering, swashbuckling screen adaptation of the popular, improvisational, role-playing, fantasy game. If you've never played D&D, learn a bit about it before you go."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves uses CGI in many creative and funny ways. The effects lend themselves to the comedy.
"""Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves"" is a lot of fun. A lot of fun. It's energetic, campy and full of action. Has Chris Pine ever been this enjoyable to watch? He's great. And no, you don't need to know a thing about D&D to enjoy this movie."
A third-tier Lord of the Rings knockoff... [The material] just doesn't lend itself to a movie.
“Dungeon & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” is a fine film that delivers what the trailers promised. This fantasy action comedy is entertaining and left me content.  
"Pine is a gem, the surrounding cast are all strong, and the world is well-built. But the number one thing this writer-director team gets right is the understanding that both the game and popcorn movies are supposed to be FUN. There's a lot of fun here."
"If you're a roleplayer who knows their Waterdeep from their Baldur's Gate, add another star to the rating. Everyone else, this is solid three-star fun and a welcome big-budget addition to the genre of cinematic fantasy."
"…Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves proves itself to be a cut above most knuckle-headed, thud-and blunder sword and sorcery romps…"
"Mostly, Dungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves is enough of a romp — a romp with clear franchise-starting ambitions, even though there's already been three D&D movies dating back to 2000, but a romp nonetheless. "
"It's fun enough. And it does, in fact, have some dragons in it. And now that I think about it, I think I saw some dungeons as well. But don't quote me, which is a stupid thing to say within an actual quote on RT. Hey...it's late. I have to go to bed. "
"The source material is something that was built on imagination and creativity, which I didn’t sense much of in Honor Among Thieves, and I found the experience a bit mundane because of that."
Entertaining for longtime tabletop players and those who've never rolled a D20.
"An action adventure, with a solid script, stunning scenes, a championship cast and endearing performances; But above all with a powerful moral that gives the best level of entertainment for the whole family. Don't miss it. [Full Review in Spanish]
"
"Though it may struggle with pacing and an arbitrary villain, a trio of endlessly charming and deliciously ridiculous performances from Grant, Pine, and Page make Honor Among Thieves a worthy holder of the Dungeons & Dragons name."
"The main reason this story is compelling is that the characters are complex and captivating. Edgin and Simon, in particular, are flawed, and are not naturally heroic. They just stubbornly keep trying to succeed and to be better."
"Even more of a theme park movie than “Jungle Ride,” which was actually based on one...the cinematic equivalent of a mile-high roller-coaster ride with no other objective but to provide multiple jolts before screeching to an explosive halt."
The only question is why it took so long to create a low-stakes but also highly amusing version of this long-running fan favorite.  Chris Pine was perfectly cast.
"Dungeons and Dragons: Honour Among Thieves is a lot more fun than anticipated, and while the jokes often make the film soar, the comedown comes hard and fast with a narrative that holds no surprises."
"Good old-fashioned, high fantasy fun."
"A cinematic campaign that accomplishes its mission thanks to the masterful use of its weapons: Sharp script, solid performances, and magical spectacle. Although it didn’t completely steal my heart, D&D is Deliciously Delightful. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"A solid romp that is charming enough to elide those concerns, crafting a personality that eludes a lot of other like-minded original fantasy films."
"Even while it's relentlessly silly, and sometimes flat-out absurd, there's a warmly beating heart in here that grabs the viewer's affection."
"If you would like to flex your imagination a little bit, this one’s a decent family entertainer with a well-crafted blend of comedy and heart."
"I get why you might not think it’s for you. Do you like laughing? Well, then, I promise it’s for you."
Humour makes a welcome return to the fantasy genre.
"Honor Among Thieves is a rare franchise for its new faces, not overloading the mythology while introducing new characters with blind trust in an ensemble that works perfectly. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A cheaper, chintzier version of this movie might have been as much fun as these actors appear to be having."
"Clearly a work of love from its pair of directors, and it’s one of the best films of 2023..."
"A superbly entertaining family film. The right amount of humour, adventure, charm, and heart"
Better than I thought it would be! A good story and fun characters with pretty great visuals. A fun watch!
"Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez have terrific buddy-movie chemistry in a fantasy film that deftly balances high-stakes action, warm drama and clever comedy."
The camp tone is tongue-in-cheek and family-friendly – more Shrek than Assassin’s Creed. Homage and affectionate parody in equal parts...
Directors Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley have pulled together an earnestly funny swords-and-sorcery film worth adventuring out to see.
Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a rollicking great fantasy adventure. 
"Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is an absolute blast of a blockbuster. It sets out to entertain its audience, and completes that quest with wit and good cheer."
"Honor Among Thieves probably isn't destined to make my top-10 list of 2023 movies, but much its two-hour and 14 minutes passed easily. Besides, the actors, notably Pine and Rodriguez, gave the movie enough heart, grit and humor to ward off negative vibes."
The film is almost playing catch-up with itself.
"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves defines overachieving as a cinematic experience that performs above expectations with impressive practical visual effects, an immersive fantasy world, and charming, likable underdog characters. "
You really can’t expect more from a film based on “Dungeons & Dragons” and this one delivers for the players and the curious.
"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves never does anything truly surprising, but it has a lot of energy and enough craft and love for its genre to keep it entertaining."
"Much of the enjoyment comes from simply hanging out with this ragtag group as they bop along to fantastical locales, encounter creatures of all kinds, and learn to work together in the process. "
They finally made a quality D&D film.
"Reduced to a movie, D&D might merely seem like an ersatz version of Tolkien... Honor Among Thieves is certainly that, though its sense of playfulness lifts it above our large pile of geek fandom detritus."
"It' s LORD OF THE RINGS meets MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, a damn good winning combo, with storytelling at the heights of an Indiana Jones adventure. All in all, it's an old-timey Saturday Matinee in one movie, with Chris Pine giving his top ""Pine."""
"There’s nothing quite as fun as seeing a well-executed action-comedy with an audience, one that both inspires peals of laughter and those tense moments where you grab the chair in anticipation. ... Honor Among Thieves nails that sensibility."
"To my surprise, I walked in a novice, but I walked out having the most fun at the movies this year."
"Chris Pine is a genius bit of casting, because he not only brings goodwill but also his casual, unimposing swagger and a cheeky sense of frolic.

"
An honorable reboot that understands the appeals of its brand and consistently presents them with charm and panache. 
"This is a movie that gently takes you by the hand and reminds you of all of the wild, silly, reasons you love high fantasy action books and movies. It’s a joyful tale with enough easter eggs for the hardcore fans without making new fans feel left out. "
"A very funny Chris Pine leads the cast that includes the always tough Michelle Rodriguez, while Hugh Grant gets to ham it up once again as the villain. Hasbro meets Monty Python meets The Princess Bride. It's loads of fun."
"We probably have Strange Things 4 to thank for this revival, but if it has birthed a new film franchise, that’s no chore if each instalment is as colourful and good natured as this one."
"A high-fantasy action comedy of tedious slapstick and obvious punchlines you scry the instant a wannabe medieval wag opens their mouth. It’s all borderline incoherent, sketched in cheap-looking CGI."
"As Monjilla the Dragon Lady, I loved the dragon, but am doubtful about the Black and White diversity. Note that early on, the thieves pass a yurt to steal horses yet the presence of East Asians is low--one villain with few lines. "
"It’s got a great cast, lots of action, and there’s laughs, although I expected it to be a bit funnier. Both Smith and Regé-Jean Page were big stand outs. While it was a fun movie, I couldn’t get behind the pacing."
An essential film to understand the future of the MCU. [Full review in Spanish]
"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a film that also manages to balance VFX spectacle and groundedness in its third act. And although the conclusion feels slightly rushed, the ending is better than that of many MCU films we’ve seen lately.  "
"It may feel like the director ordered a truckload of kitchen sinks to throw into this chaotic, complicated-yet-dumb, serious-yet-silly, imperfect extravaganza, but he still manages to serve up an astonishing tale. "
While I still like the film overall. Every MCU movie now just becoming setup for the next is making characters like Ant-Man lose some of their charm.
"the two-dimensional supporting characters and bloated, derivative universe-building feel like pink filler for too long before flashbacks reveal Janet and Kang’s time together and give us some pique of interest."
The errors are easy to miss because the script and all of the acting performances are drenched in a goop of CGI characters that obliterate everything in their path. 
"Excessive, repetitive, unnecessary dialogue driven by exposition, along with a lack of stronger tonal balance and an underdeveloped narrative devoid of true stakes - character arcs are almost non-existent - make this an overall very inconsistent watch."
This is yet another Marvel movie where the tired trope makes its way into driving the plot: A character does something foolish which creates havoc for their world while most of the original cast is separated from one another the bulk of the time.
"For most of its run-time, it feels like a filler episode of an anime, with only its climax operating as a narrative “threshold”."
"Ant Man And The Wasp Quantumania  The film’s first act kicks off as a badass Star Wars Adventure BUT slowly tires out towards the middle. Fun? Absolutely! Exposition heavy? Yes!
A mixed bag overall "
Marvel isn’t in the business of telling stories. They are in the business of selling action figures. That’s why you have so many characters wearing brand-new but hideous-looking costumes frolicking around to pad the runtime.
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a good time.
 This movie looks bad.
"Everything about it is phony and flat from the start, visually unappealing and narratively aimless."
The supposedly limitless storytelling device has been pushed to its narrative limits. Just look to Quantumania for proof.
Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror is almost the only great thing about this quasi-animated film that was supposed to bring life to a most expected quantum realm. [Full review in Spanish]
Creative world building and a compelling villain performance from Jonathan Majors helps 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' deliver as a solid superhero movie.
"Like it or not, this is the ouroboros the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become. Kang's backstory may be a little more convoluted than Thanos's, but in the end he also just wants to ""burn the broken worlds"" to create a better one."
"The Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Phase Ho-Hum ended with the release of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and Phase Shoulder Shrug kicks off with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania."
"This feels like a ""stepping stone"" film that came off like a ""Star Wars"" rip-off. This didn't move the needle for the MCU or these characters. "
I wasn't a big fan of this movie and some of the performances. I was surprised with how low the stakes in this story were. Kang was wasted and Michael Pena was greatly missed.
"While it had some pleasing visuals and some strong performances from Paul Rudd and others Quantumania still managed to fall flat. It’s not a bad film, it’s not a good film, it’s firmly in the extremely mundane middle…"
"…this film’s action sorely lacks the ingenious charm offered by the super-scale skirmishes seen in the first two Ant-Man films, and the result is incomprehensible gibberish…"
All you’ll find is another building block of content that will come out quarterly but leave no lasting impression.
It's a two-hour-long computer-generated video game that stays afloat because of two things: Rudd's comic timing and Majors' acting clinic.
"Visually, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is incredible, with precise details and colors exploding everywhere on screen."
Be thankful you didn't squander your money at the box-office! This atrocious escapade is one of the most worthless entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
"Appropriately for the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s tiniest heroes, the charms of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” are small, but still satisfying,"
"The general color-drenched too-muchness of it all might be tolerable if the plot wasn’t such a by-the-numbers slog, alternating hyperkinetic action sequences with draggy recitations of exposition."
...this trip into Quantumania is a missed opportunity.
"Most unfortunate of all, the usually reliable Paul Rudd coasts through this one, wearing his charisma like an old shirt that he forgot to wash and iron before putting on, assuming we'd just love seeing it (and him) again. "
Quantumania has the goods. It lets Majors take new big bad Kang out for a joyride without feeling like he’s just slumming it in an Ant-Man picture.
"The MCU spent Phase 4 showing a sprawling universe at some point, they’re all going to have to come together to beat the crap out of each other. We’ve got a whole multiverse to sit down to, so let Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania be that appetizer."
I love Marvel and understand the implications the film is supposed to have as it ushers in Phase 5. What I’m at a loss to understand is just why this task was laid at the feet of Ant-Man. 
"Because audiences warm to Paul Rudd’s humor, his third stand-alone Ant-Man outing should have gone for the laughs, not some convoluted mythology that explains nothing."
"Far from the best the MCU has to offer but fun, energetic, and quirky enough to overlook its flaws. Also: Jonathan Majors. "
"While Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’s overwhelming onslaught of half baked CGI and hamfisted performances may be the bulk of the film’s over two hour runtime, one performer who isn’t sleepwalking to his payday is Jonathan Majors."
A disastrous mess with the Ant population expanding. Even the family gardener has a suit which means Scott Lang’s role is reduced to carrying everybody’s luggage.
"You have a great cast that gets lost in an overstuffed story. There's no emotional connections, so many of the characters just didn't get enough screen time, and the goals of what they're setting up with Kang feel too abstract."
I cannot imagine ranking it anywhere other than dead last out of the 31 features presently constituting the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Clumsy storytelling and underdeveloped characters unfortunately prevented it from being the spectacular strong start that Phase 5 needed it to be.
"Quantumania is a lifeless, mirthless CGI saturnalia that dispenses almost entirely with the emotional core of its characters. In its place, Peyton Reed and his production team have resorted to the worst sort of empty spectacle filmmaking."
"The whole thing seems to be built almost entirely on cliches and tropes, with no gravity, no sense of impact or consequence."
"As a standalone movie, it falls squarely right in the center of worth it and not worth it to see in theaters."
"Despite a smattering of jokes, Peyton Reed’s film just isn’t as much fun as the others. "
With very small powers come no real responsibilities.
Not even Rudd’s effortless charisma can save the characters from feeling lost against a background of grey-brown sludge and unremarkable landscaping. 
"I liked this film a lot, the fun and the humor are still there, but the stakes are definitively raised. "
"... While the film has a bunch of things to pick apart, it's aesthetic and visual enjoyability isn't one of them."
"I thought this was fun, entertaining, visually interesting, the characters worked well, and the villain is spot on. Is it amazing? Is it top tier? No, I don't think it was ever going to be. But I don't regret my time with it."
[Jonathan Majors] elevated the material and was in a realm altogether... [But the movie] was too drunk on its own mythology.
"Jonathan Majors is just outstanding. He's in a different movie, giving a Shakespearean performance in what is otherwise... well, it's Ant-Man. "
"""Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania"" is going to be lower on the MCU movie list. But, with its thrilling action sequences and funny one liners, this sequel makes for an enjoyable 
blockbuster that's worth catching on the big screen."
"ANT-MAN & THE WASP: Quantumania feels more like a Disney+ special than a film.

It’s messy, overindulgent on weak CGI, and humor falls flat. Jonathan Majors is great as Kang but Marvel seemed more focused on creating a 2-hour trailer for something better."
"Quantumania swings big, but forgets the small stuff, to its own detriment."
A movie about Ant-Man & Wasp would do well to focus on Ant-Man & Wasp.
"In a universe with 20+ films, one of them has to be the worst, and Quantamania is a strong contender for that inauspicious title, lacking any emotional mooring or reason to care whatsoever"
"Ant-Man is for wacky capers and comic relief in Avengers movies, not exposition-heavy narrative centerpieces responsible for setting up the next three years of cinematic storytelling."
"31 films deep in the MCU means there are bound to be a few duds. The barrage of overblown effects and a story devoid of emotion makes this entry a bottom dweller. The good news, Phase 5 can only get better."
"Anyone who fears that too many blockbusters are becoming too similar won't feel fortunate while watching... The MCU is going massive on Kang, patently; if only it'd kept the Ant-Man pictures small."
"More sci-fi than superhero flick this time, taking cues from Star Wars and gets really fantastical. While it may not be the best in the series, it's a totally fun installment and one that's worth seeing on the big screen."
"All of this makes the plot feel both murky and corny, while the action is less than convincing. Still, the cast is on fine form, finding moments of emotion alongside the snarky relationship humour."
A prologue that desperately seeks to make the irrelevant relevant. [Full review in Spanish]
"The Quantum Realm is strikingly similar to that other space movie, if not a chintzy reproduction whose heavy CGI work is like lipstick on a space boar. "
"I can't remember ever wanting to walk out during a press screening of any post-2008 Marvel movie, but I had the urge this time around and wouldn't have missed much had I followed that impulse."
"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is pure, indulgent escapism that never forgets comic book movies are supposed to be fun."
"The ensuing plot is mostly gibberish, full of universe-threatening stakes that are too easily overcome."
"After three movies, and a couple of Avengers appearances, we finally get a Scott and Cassie movie. "
"Is it worth watching this to keep up with the MCU? Sure. It's hard not to root for the ""little guy."" But this movie is ""just fine"" instead of particularly funny, thrilling, or memorable. "
Crawls instead of buzzes.
"The more appealing thing about the whole enterprise is the mental image of these former A-listers hanging out between takes, swapping stories of the old days and competing over who least understands the script."
"By virtue of placing a character that is nearly street level with a universe threatening opponent, you have to make the movie rise to meet it. However Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is largely stuck in needing to be bigger."
"Portrayed by Jonathan Majors, Kang is an intense menacing presence who gives the MCU the jolt it has sorely needed since Avengers: End Game."
"nt-Man 3 is a fun if predictable superhero movie that gets a few big things wrong, but bounces back on the strength of its leads, with both Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors knocking it out of the park."
A return to what Marvel does best ... teasing the next movie.
"Rarely has a film about a family in peril been so utterly devoid of suspense. The problem, it seems, is that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania exists as part of a larger enterprise."
One good scene can't fix a film overloaded with so much plot -- and so many characters -- that you'll actually wish everyone slowed down to tell their corny jokes.
The thrill is gone. The Marvel Universe shoots a blank. A tiny one.
"The stand-out element is Majors, whose unsettlingly cool, calm and collected performance as Kang will have you eagerly anticipating his next MCU appearance."
"As another Merry Marvel Continuity Exercise, it could be a lot worse. At least they have a compellingly-acted villain again, even if they aren’t quite sure what to do with him on the way to their destination."
"'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' is the weirdest, most fun movie of the three. Yet, it's bogged down by serving as another stepping stone on the road to Marvel's Multiverse Saga."
"An uneven mix of comedy and action that lacks epicness, but thrives on introducing a dangerous new villain. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"The film covers no new ground, offers no new concepts. and introduces almost nothing fresh in the way of storytelling or character development. Rudd and Reed made a solid duo in the past, but this time around the formula stands out more than the charm."
It's nice Hollywood's been scouring metaphysical and cosmological texts and translating them into comic book popcorn entertainment (The Quantum Realm!) but the over-usage of CGI as a lazy replacement for the craft of good storytelling is tedious.
"There are some truly fun pieces to it, some genuinely inventive and impressive visuals, and a mostly likable cast. But it doesn’t do enough to separate itself from the blurred, messy palette that the MCU has become to truly stand out. It’s… fine."
"Tentatively pushing into broader fantasy cinema, it retains frissons for those of us who did grow up having our imaginations blown open by Jack Kirby. "
"As far as superhero action movies go, this one works well enough. There is plenty of action and plenty of imaginative eye candy. The acting is good. The soundtrack is also solid. It should prove to be a popular addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"It suffers from some script problems in the first half, but it ultimately delivers a bonkers but exciting gateway to the next Marvel phase."
"The visuals are so busy, the jokes so tame, the homilies so overfamiliar, the only option is surrendering to the chaos. But those pros Pfeiffer and Douglas up the game with an interstellar Romancing the Stone vibe. "
The lackluster writing and typical Marvel clichés don't allow for Rudd's effortless charm to carry the character. 
"Thoroughly enjoyed Ant Man And The Wasp: Quantumania. Jonathan Majors is a superstar with Michelle Pfeiffer matching him beat for beat. The world building of the Quantum Realm is stunning. It has the right mix of humor, emotional stakes, action, and awe. "
Talent can't hide the fact that the movie gets less and less interesting as it progresses.  [Full review in Spanish] 
It is good moments overwhelmed by a bloated structure. 
"While an ant can lift  5,000 times its own body weight, there's little to support here."
"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania takes you on a fun adventure. And, as always, stay back for Easter eggs in the mid and post credit scenes."
"This film is silly and messy and pretty and trippy, and though it fulfills the obligations of vweepy laser fights, digital everything, and several different varieties of product placement, it’s not going to reshape the marketplace."
"One of Marvel's most visually inventive films with fantastical world-building, and the franchise's most imposing villain yet in Kang the Conqueror."
"Nearly immediately, director Peyton Reed stomps on the gas, plunging our itsy-bitsy heroes into chases, fistfights, battle sequences and other assorted setpieces. "
You really don't have to do this to yourself. You have the power to walk away. 
The real badass presence of Jonathan Majors  and Michelle Pfeiffer going toe to toe in the mulitverse will keep audiences on their toes and salivating for more. 
"Netflix's ambitious biopic imposes an unnecessarily unrestrictive straitjacket on itself, preventing Rustin from truly doing justice to its protagonist. [Full review in Spanish] "
Actor Colman Domingo transforms himself into Rustin and g9ives an amazing performance.
When it’s over you’ll be convinced that Bayard Rustin should be a household name.
The film doesn’t go far enough to say anything of substance.
"Rustin, the man, is ultimately more memorable than Rustin the film, even though Wolfe’s intentions and Colman’s passionate performance about race and freedom are strong, important and so relevant now. 
"
Domingo can be such a compelling force to watch on screen that it’s a shame to see him leading such a by-the-numbers biopic about a notable figure from the civil rights movement. 
I thought it was very well done. Colman Domingo is totally compelling.
"While it lacks the risk-taking that the story deserved, the movie invites us to reflect upon the marginalization of certain heroes in history. [Full review in Spanish]"
"If you’re putting together a short list of Best Actor Oscar nominees, save a spot for Colman Domingo, who grabs the role of Rustin with both hands and does not let go."
"This welcome spotlight on a lesser-known civil rights hero doesn’t escape the usual biopic clichés — but Colman Domingo’s impressive, deeply layered performance does this corner of history justice."
"Rustin keeps its eye on the prize throughout, affording Rustin, whose role in the civil-rights movement was overlooked due to his sexuality, a rightful place in history. "
"George C. Wolfe’s film tells the story pretty straight: luckily for him, it’s a really good one."
"Poorly directed but passionately performed, Netflix's biopic of the overlooked Civil Rights activist Bayard Rustin lets star Colman Domingo down with subpar storytelling."
Colman Domingo gives one of the year's very best performances.
"Domingo’s energetic, commanding performance holds the center of the film, but he’s ill-served by the formulaic approach to storytelling that unfolds around him. "
"Wolfe’s beautiful film works two-fold, as a portrait of a man whose name you’ve likely never heard, and as a captivating chronicle of one of the most politically meaningful events in American history."
"As written, “Rustin” does a pretty good job of making the (re-)introductions. As acted, the movie transcends pretty-good."
What brings this film outrageously to life is the combination of a smart script and a blazing performance by Colman Domingo.
Domingo delivers one of the year’s best performances as a man who fought public and private battles on multiple fronts. 
Rustin lacks the boldness of the man it seeks to portray. Rustin’s character is flattened and constrained by the genre. 
Colman Domingo gives a career defining performance as Bayard Rustin in this biopic about an unsung hero in history. 
"It's occasionally more interested in generating applause-worthy soundbites than anything else, but Domingo proves once again capable of making anything he touches shine."
"Rustin is solid, slightly stagey film-making that is elevated by a thrillingly dynamic central performance from the versatile Colman Domingo."
"Rustin persevered enough to succeed in ways that put many of us to shame. There is no doubt that he had a dream, too, and this film by director George C. Wolfe works hard to show how his subject brought it to fruition."
"It matters not only for its hero, but for how his story is told -- by and for those who shared his struggles and still feel their impact the most today."
"Rustin finally works better as history than it does as drama. While its namesake might have assisted King’s rise to the mountaintop, in cinematic terms, the movie occupies a tier somewhere below it."
"If the film’s goal is to raise the profile of Rustin – over being a tight, suspenseful drama – consider that met. Without the spot-on casting of Domingo, though, it might not be so memorable..."
"All in all, one walks away from Rustin enchanted with Domingo’s performance, while feeling that a character as larger than life and momentous as Bayard Rustin surely deserves a film less dutiful and more inspired."
"Rustin, for all of its flaws, is worth watching in every way because of the beauty of witnessing Coleman Domingo act."
... explores with even-handed conviction the complicated legacy of a man often relegated to a behind-the-scenes figure who never was granted the recognition and appreciation he deserved.
Colman Domingo is just a force of nature in this movie.
"It's directed by George C. Wolfe, who most recently did Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. He's great with actors, and... great with period detail. I think both of those things are terrific in this movie."
"With “Rustin,” Wolfe opens up his camera in a conventional manner that works but not nearly as well as his previous effort."
"Mr. Domingo is a force of nature in this film, delivering a complex, highly sympathetic portrayal, but he also determines what the movie actually is, while preventing it from going awry. "
"A riveting performance from Colman Domingo and an important untold story propel the Netflix biopic, “Rustin.” "
"As Rustin, Colman Domingo delivers the performance of his career. Known for flashy supporting roles in Euphoria and Fear the Walking Dead, Domingo captures the effervescence of Rustin without leaning on mannerisms or mimicry."
"Rustin is another effective, entertaining example of what happens when you bring the right people in to tell a true story -- their story -- the right way."
There’s such a sheen of biopic respectability coating Rustin—Netflix’s new award-season entrant—that you almost miss how radical it is. 
"Colman Domingo gives a award winning performance. His incredible talent radiates in every scene, as we explore this story about perseverance and self worth. George C. Wolfe direction is both upbeat and inspirational."
"Every so often an actor so dominates a movie that its success largely hinges on his every word and gesture. That’s the case with Coleman Domingo’s galvanic title performance in “Rustin""..."
"I loved the subject matter but was left disappointed with the storytelling. Instead of watching this one, just pick up a history book.  "
"You leave the film knowing that you’ve met a hero, but that this remarkable man deserved more."
"By times, Rustin feels rushed with an odd rhythm. But, the final moments as the March on Washington comes to life, are moving, empowering and pack an emotional punch, as does the portrait of a behind the scenes trailblazer and hero."
"None other than Colman Domingo, one of the most versatile working actors, can capture Bayard Rustin’s persona. "
"Flaws and all, it draws us in, and we emerge entertained, satisfied and deeply moved."
"Rustin is one of the most important and illuminating movies of the year, shining a spotlight on little-known leader of the Civil Rights Movement, Bayard Rustin. Colman Domingo gives an Oscar-worthy performance."
If Rustin only gives you a slice of a story -- you could make seven different films out of his life and achievements -- it assures you walk away knowing who Bayard Rustin was. The same can be said for Colman Domingo. Attention must be paid a hundredfold.
There’s a brightness to Rustin that doesn’t veer away from the consequences at the intersections of Bayard Rustin’s life. It allows the story to breathe like jazz.
It is a film that flies by and leaves you knowing more than you knew going in and wanting to learn more after.
This was an incredibly powerful film. Colman nailed Rustin down to the smallest detail. Phenomenal performance in a very powerful and tasteful film. 
"There's a few editing choices and the Lenny Kravitz song that I didn't quite connect with, but this movie is a phenomenal showcase for the fantastic Colman Domingo! His towering performance deserves to be in every awards conversation!"
"Magnificent.
Director George Wolfe hits another one out of the park on the heels of his perfect ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.""
Coleman Domingo gives a tour de force performance.
This is Coleman Domingo's moment!"
"But Domingo has never had the opportunity to anchor a film like he does here, and it’s a bravura performance, full of fire, heart, doubt and fear playing a man who believed in the best pf humanity and beat to a different drummer."
"It's a terrible, scattered, unpleasant movie in nearly every way except one: Colman Domingo's committed, energetic, downright thrilling work as the movie's subject, which elevates it to the point of ""sort of watchable."""
"Because Rustin’s words are inherently awe-inspiring, and the dapper Domingo delivers them with consistent excellence, the movie moves up more notches than it might otherwise. "
"This film can serve as inspiration to work daily toward shaking off the humility that prevents us from being our full selves. If not for us, then for the sake of generations after."
Colman Domingo owns this movie: triumphant performance.
"As straight-down-the-middle biopics go, Rustin stands out just enough thanks to some genuinely compelling material and a truly special central performance."
"Rustin is still one of the most engaging and unflinchingly heartfelt films we’ve seen this year, a perfectly apt tribute to a towering figure who is only now receiving due credit for his impact on the fight for equality."
"That's a lot of territory and Rustin, a semi-successful bio-pic built around a strong performance by Colman Domingo, covers some of it, even as the richness and sweep of Rustin's life plays second fiddle to the March on Washington."
"Jeffrey Wright as Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. in “Rustin” might be the year’s best bad guy in a movie."
Rustin is a long overdue biopic with a shining performance from Colmon Domingo.
"The draw for “Rustin,” aside from the depiction of an incredible moment in American history, is the showcase performance by Colman Domingo."
"Wolfe hasn't reinvented the biopic wheel with this film, but he and the writers don't shy away from showing that the civil rights movement was inhabited by humans. "
"The visual flair and convincing period detail is matched by Domingo's towering portrayal, with every line of dialogue delivered like a call to arms. "
"Colman Domingo is an absolute knockout giving voice and fiery passion to Bayard Rustin. Domingo has been on Broadway, won an Emmy for Euphoria, and should be part of the Best Actor Oscar conversation. "
"Rustin, however, is a cinematic conception that feels stagey in the wrong ways. The dialogue is stiltedly explicative, with characters practically introduced by their verbal resumes. "
[Coleman Domingo's] performance adds life to the movie’s informative but prosaic history lesson.
"[George C. Wolfe] can’t escape biopic cliches, as real life’s inevitable progress dulls imagination. His and Domingo’s love for their subject anyway powers a sufficiently complex character study, and resurrects an exemplary American hero."
Rustin is a bold and generous movie that sets its conventional biopic wrapper on fire. 
"Exploring the mechanics of this epochal event is a great idea, led by a memorable performance from Domingo, that somehow still manages to render the protest march as flat and lifeless as any obligatory TV-movie checklist."
"A smart, compact script (the movie runs just 106 minutes) coupled with Colman’s empathetic-yet-wily performance and the steady hand of director George C. Wolfe ensure that “Rustin” largely avoids biopic cliches."
"In its attempt to show the “warts and all” political details within the Civil Rights movement, it ultimately becomes the kind of hagiography it wants to avoid."
" Domingo creates a Rustin larger than life, but intimate enough to leave a lasting impression. Still, he remains almost as enigmatic as when the picture began. But at least we now know the name. It’s Rustin, and I’ll wager you won’t soon forget it.  "
Colman Domingo gives an excellent performance as Rustin and the supporting cast is strong
While the movie itself can be problematic...Colman Domingo’s transformational performance is so inspiring it is difficult not to get swept up in it.
"It’s Domingo who carries every moment with his energetic, inspiring performance, which will surely find Netflix campaigning for him during awards season. Nevertheless, the by-the-numbers screenplay and filmmaking fail the actor."
"The film’s a lively, shallow history lesson – you come out knowing a lot about the March on Washington but still wanting to know more about Rustin."
"A stirring portrait of an oft-unsung civil rights hero and queer trailblazer, 'Rustin' doesn't deliver on all of its promise."
Sad times when a film this square feels radical.
"It’s a powerful story that succeeds despite some of the movie’s flawed narrative choices; from its misshapen structure, where a certain randomness seems to dictate what to leave in and out, to a tendency to lay it on thick."
"Domingo captures every side of the man, from his swagger to his boyishness, his cajoling side to his hectoring will. It’s truly one of the best performances this year."
This well-meaning and well-acted film shines a necessary spotlight on those behind the scenes of a movement.
"The script, co-written by Dustin Lance Black, who won an Oscar for Milk, is sometimes plodding and formulaic but allows Domingo enough showpiece scenes of struggle and perseverance to make the hard-won finale truly tear-jerking."
A routine biopic blessed with an electrifying star...valuable and historical...
"Scripted by Julian Breece and Dustin Lance Black, the film is most compelling in these intimate moments, highlighting Rustin’s tenderness and resilience. "
"“Rustin” was undoubtedly made in admiration of its subject. Yet, with a stale approach to its plotline and confused narrative priorities, the film is more like an educational outline than a spirited story."
"Fortunately, it has a ... stirring, exuberant lead performance by Colman Domingo."
Rustin's fierce intellectualism and personal eccentricities are captured vibrantly by Domingo. It's the kind of performance that screams out for awards season.
"Director George C. Wolfe had a dream to put unsung civil-rights firebrand Bayard Rustin front and center in a movie and now, with the help of producers Barack and Michelle Obama and a thrilling acting tour de force from the great Colman Domingo, he has. "
"You want to change the world? Gather some like-minded souls, roll up your sleeves and dream. It might, this optimistic film posits, come true."
"Enough cannot be said about Domingo, a recognizable character actor in shows like “Euphoria” who has finally been given his moment to shine in the lead."
"It's admirable the filmmakers want to bring Rustin into the spotlight, but as portrayed here, his life is still defined by the people and events surrounding him."
Colman Domingo delivers one of the best performances of 2023
"Rustin’s victories were harder won, and his losses more bitter and more numerous, than Rustin is willing to acknowledge. Hope is vital, but for hope to feel real, we need to acknowledge a Rustin who was more acquainted with despair."
"Bayard Rustin may not have spoken at the March on Washington, but this film teaches us that he was as responsible as anyone for cementing its place in the history books."
"Bayard Rustin deserves to be remembered for the entirety of his being, both as an activist and as an openly gay Black man in a time when it was criminal. As much as 'Rustin' attempts to balance both, it carries the former better than the latter."
The breakout lead performance by Colman Domingo as the 60s civil rights organizer Bayard Rustin makes this modestly budgeted biographical drama pop like a Broadway musical.
"A poignant and effective look at a point where the fight for equal racial and sexual rights uneasily intersected, Rustin follows a basic biopic template, but applies it to a story that hasn’t been told to death countless times before."
"Director George C. Wolfe, a theater legend, keeps this biopic intriguing, making it almost feel like a caper. "
"I missed seeing Pig on its original release, and that was my mistake. Do not make the same one. This is vital, unmissable cinema."
Cage elevates Sarnoski’s visuals. The actor is a vortex of emotions that quietly burn beneath a lonely exterior.
"PIG is ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF 2021. It’s not Mandy, it’s not A John Wick Clone, it’s a somber, subdue, & profound film on the meaning in the meaningless of things to others & ourselves."
"Pig may not be for everyone, but it is still worth the watch. It is a gentle, slow-burn movie, that while not perfect and a bit messy in some places, is undeniably a great piece of cinema."
Pig goes on a mission to redefine traditional masculine roles. There’s an unspoken vulnerability in it that employs unexpected methods and unmanly emotions to highlight something that’s inherently rooted in all men: tenderness.
"This is perhaps the most empathetic movie of the year, featuring characters with motivations that are clear and easy to understand while still holding plenty of subtle depth. "
"Pig will haunt you and allow you to contemplate its rich themes if you allow yourself to open up to its cerebral style. In return for opening yourself up, Pig will indeed satisfyingly cleanse your cinephile palette."
Debutante Sarnoski's austere and modest narrative drive is essential to Cage's luminous performance... [Full review in Spanish]
"A rarity. One waits for a proverbial wink to let us know that we're experiencing a strange joke of a film. But the wink never arrives, and once we realize that this is a serious movie, we reach unthinkable dramatic levels. [Full review in Spanish]"
This is Cage’s best performance in years... Pig takes the humblest ingredients and delivers a Michelin-star cinematic feast.
"Pig is a solemn yet subtly stirring character study that expertly subverts expectations, elevated by Nicolas Cage ’s best performance in nearly two decades."
Sarnoski fully earns our empathy despite not fully satisfying our curiosity. 
Sarnoski skews from the customary revenge thriller and plays with the crazed image Cage has constructed in the past decade and a half to bring us something completely unexpected. [Full review in Spanish]
Pig is proof that [Cage] is capable of elevating a film that many will come to watch expecting a good time and will be left with tears in their eyes. [Full review in Spanish]
"... With a cold mise en scene and a contemplative, sedated rhythm, Pig proves that there isn't a colder dish than a broken, lost soul. [Full review in Spanish]"
"What gives this strange film most of its beauty, emotional brutality, and poignant power is Cage, whose work exudes mystery, and tenderness, and suppressed rage.  [Full review in Spanish]"
"It gives the impression that a good part of the film's findings are more found than really sought after, more chance than fair and accurate reflection.  [Full review in Spanish] "
"[Nicolas Cage] brings a grace to his scenes in the kitchen, showing us a man whose respect for the raw materials of his dishes borders on spiritual and whose ease with the tools of the trade reveals a mastery born of experience."
"Tranquil, and sensible.
[Full review in Spanish]"
"A stunning, spellbinding piece of cinema."
"Dark, brooding yet surprisingly sentimental, Pig takes a simple concept of a truffle hunter looking for his stolen pig and turns this offbeat mystery into an emotionally moving story. The film's main appeal is a standout performance by Nicolas Cage."
At no point did I forget that I was watching a Nicolas Cage performance. This supposedly heartfelt little drama feels forced from beginning to end.
"Like finding a truffle in the mud, Pig may be rough around the edges but offers something very different. If you only see one of the three Nicolas Cage films out this year, make it this. "
Pig is a rare film that treats its characters with an open heart and its themes with an intimate profundity that never feels affected or disingenuous.
Pig is the type of controlled and elevated drama that sticks with you.
"If Pig still resonates with many viewers, that's partly because the movie draws us in visually, with the painterly dark tones of a Renaissance interior. But it's mostly because Cage sells the crap out of his role."
"A profound and nuanced meditation on grief, Pig is simply one of the best movies of 2021."
"A film about how we respond to tragedy and injustice, Pig is both timely and timeless."
"This is a rare and meaty role for Academy Award winner Cage, whose restraint here is admirable. He speaks in hushed tones instead of grander histrionics...he subtly pulls off this reflective loner with definitive artistry."
It's the sort of transcendental experience that you hope for every time you sit down for a new movie.
...impressively fresh and increasingly mesmerizing...
"Boasting one of the most beautiful final shots of the last decade, Pig is for anyone who has ever yearned for the other side of loss. I think about it at least once a day."
"A career-best, layered performance from Nic Cage. Michael Sarnoski is a filmmaker to watch in his feature directorial debut, a slo-burn but solid character-driven drama that deals with someone's fraught legacy."
(Cage) gives one of the...can't miss performances of 2021.
"A study of grief and regret, with a Nic Cage who has remembered how to convey these emotions through subtle facial gestures and specific actions. [Full review in Spanish]"
A touching meditation on grief and a critique of the high-end restaurant scene.
A terrifically serious movie.
I will probably select Nicolas Cage for my actor nominations I am voting for. He's great and the movie is a winner.
The film is no Truffle Hunters. But Cage keeps it watchable.
"Rob (Cage) is a fascinating character. A man of quiet courage and dignity, he imparts a kind of wisdom to others that is universal. That is because he, unlike most people, has come to terms with the utter finality of death."
The pig really is beautiful; a purebred Kunekune with auburn hair and expressive eyes.
"This movie has plenty to say about fraught family relationships and the transformative power of a good meal, but Rob's takedown of fine dining makes this story of a man looking for his pig stand out from the pack."
"Pig is about acknowledging the irreversible nature of grief and accepting the bleakest memories of our lives. It is a beautifully acted, complex film deserving of repeat viewings."
"Pig is a melancholic, thoughtful debut from writer-director Michael Sarnoski, and Cage's raw performance will make your heart ache and remind you how superb he can be with the right material."
"If you have an open mind, you will be rewarded with a melancholic and poignant story, and a superb, triumphant performance from Cage who has no trouble reminding audiences that he is an Oscar winner capable of incredible range and depth."
"There are few actors who could pull off this tonal balancing act as successfully as Cage... Over the years, some have questioned how far he's in on his own joke -- but at this point, there's no doubting his finely tuned sense of the ridiculous."
"A quietly poignant and strangely beautiful little gem that touched my heart like few other films this year, Pig is a deeply special wonder."
"Nicolas Cage is mesmerizing in this contemplative and existential story of grief, acceptance and true happiness. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Subtle enough in its intentions, but clear in its execution, Pig utilises Nicolas Cage's superb performance to produce a rare showcase of anti-violence, identity, grief, and hope."
"With brilliant performances, assured direction and an engrossing emotional core within its story, Pig rewards the patient with gripping honesty and fantastic filmmaking. Nicolas Cage delivers a nuanced yet emotionally thrilling performance."
"Cage is magnificent with young Alex Wolff 100 percent holding his own opposite him, and the writing, the pace, it's a cinematic feast."
There's a fair bit to unpick here and Pig provides a nice balance of intrigue and dramatic action.
"Most of this wouldn't simmer the way that it does without Cage, who delivers one of his finest performances in recent memory, and it's a pleasure to see a filmmaker willing to resist the easy path and trust in his actor's ability to underplay."
"A deeply moving film with twists and turns that few could see coming, Pig is - amongst other things - a timely reminder of just how good Nicolas Cage is at his job."
"The narrative arrow couldn't be straighter -- Robin wants his pig back -- but the filmmaking lacks urgency. I wasn't feeling it, and I wasn't buying it."
"One of the year's finest films, serving us all with a reminder of how masterful an actor [Nicolas] Cage can be."
"It's unmistakably a movie where Cage plays a truffle hunter on a quest for revenge after his adored pet pig is stolen, but this moving and humanistic picture is also welcomely and entrancingly so much more than that."
A unique pleasure of a movie.
"With its sullen mood very carefully kept from crossing the line into comedy, where it could easily have gone, Pig unspools as a thoughtful, if undemanding cinematic tone poem about one man's reluctant journey back into a world he had turned his back on."
"One of the most unusual, touching and humanistic films about love and loss in recent years."
"With arguably Nicolas Cage's best-ever performance in a feature film, a deep psychological and humanised story and a striking score by Alexis Grapsas and Philip Klein, Michael Sarnoski's feature debut is a true tour de force."
"Cage's soulful, lived-in performance in Pig isn't likely to join the actor's infamous YouTube showreels but it'll linger long in the memory, like a really great meal."
"It's bracing to encounter another film that trusts its audience to be reasonably smart, empathetic human beings."
"Pig is a special little film, one that Cage should be proud of."
"Nicolas Cage's central performance is mesmerising, and as subtle as it is powerful."
"Pig feels unbalanced and a little too much. However, if you want to see Nicolas Cage act cool, calm and collected, I can't think of a better movie you should watch..."
"[Pig] tells us to keep living, in spite of the losses that we face in the way."
"The film offers a tender portrait of a secret culture, a vanishing way of life and the clash between traditionalists who work slowly and methodically and a world that demands instant results."
"Given the leading man's CV, it comes as a surprise that Pig eschews action-packed showdowns and instead paints a mournful, thought-provoking portrait of a figure haunted by an unspoken past he'd rather not revisit."
"Nicolas Cage delivers a moving, naturalistic performance."
It may feel like one of the smallest movies I'll see this year but Pig definitely feels like one of the best.
Cage muzzles his eccentric energy to deliver a low-key performance that embodies Pig's distinctive blend of dry humour and brooding existentialism.
"Pig offers something strangely tender and even sometimes lyrical, wrapped up in the trappings of a noirish thriller that is as much a satire on the meaning of value and social status as it is a straightforward revenge film."
"On paper, the set-up for Pig may lead to eye-rolling and chuckles, but it's a film with a lot of integrity and a strong emotional core. Like a good chef, it brings the elements together to create something tasty, edifying and very memorable."
"It's easy to underestimate Michael Sarnoski's low-key picture but Cage's performance is a dishevelled joy and it does eventually have some quietly powerful things to say about loss, grief and livestock."
"Cage plays the role like it was Macbeth: weary, mournful, tender, with gusts of rage and grief."
"Though the film is teed up as a kind of John Wick-style revenge bender, Cage's star persona is soon smartly subverted."
"Pig shouldn't be a revelation to anyone who's been following these men's careers, but it's a perfect reminder of how easily we can underestimate people."
Action-packed and yet gently meditative.
Nicolas Cage might not command 20million for a film any more but this emotionally wrought drama proves he can still make a priceless contribution.
Cage keeps it small with a magnetic turn as a mournful sort of philosopher-chef.
"In going against type, Pig is less the film you want, more the film you need. Dialled back, profoundly human, and with Nicolas Cage on finest form, it leaves a tangible sense of having witnessed something intimate and almost majestic."
"His most contemplative performance in years, a reminder of a time when David Lynch hailed Cage as ""the jazz musician of American acting""."
This is the movie for which the term sui generis was invented.
"Pig is an unexpected character piece with depth and moments of pure tranquil bliss, mixed in with enough grit and blood that would usually make a casual appearance in a modern Nicolas Cage film."
"If Nicolas Cage's latter-day roles can be broadly categorised as ""wage Cage"" (the stuff he does for money) or ""rage Cage"" (the crazy performances his fans love), his latest film Pig might necessitate a new classification: ""sage Cage""."
"Anyone who's been keeping faith with Nicolas Cage, through all his career's snaking cul-de-sacs and mad escapades, has a tremendous reward in store when they sit down to Pig."
"The great Nicholas Cage absolutely makes this incredibly unique film about food, companionship (and much more) well worth your time."
...that rare sense of revelation without contrivance or artifice makes this an exemplary movie...
An offbeat tale of a man facing up to his past for the love of his porcine partner.
"'Pig' is not what one would see coming given it's beginning premise, but Cage's meditation of a man searching for purpose is something to be seen."
"Pig plays out like a modern western, with just a pinch of Pixar's Ratatouille adding a few more tender notes."
"Cage is as mesmeric as ever, showing off his chops, as it were, with a slow performance to match a story about a character devoted to slow food and locavore authenticity."
"You think Pig is going to be one thing because it sounds sorta crazy, but it's not. It's actually a subtle, human drama."
An outstanding debut. Pair with wine and someone you love.
A gorgeous piece of whimsy.
"Nicolas Cage gives his most dramatic, subtle, and truly special performance in quite some time. May just be the best film of 2021."
"Quiet, unforced and delicate, Pig provides a forum for Nicolas Cage, one of our most dazzling showmen, to get serious and burrow more deeply into his talent than he has in years."
"Subtle, sorrowful and savory."
"Dare you threaten John Wick's dog? Honor the pig as well. The farmer had his reasons for leaving, some of which we learn as Cage graces another mid-career surprise."
"Bullet Train’s driving engine quickly loses steam. Its runtime is never justified, especially when it chooses to prioritize odd tangents over cogent and streamlined storytelling. 

"
"Bullet Train is bombastic and silly, but it rarely pretends to be anything else. Is it a great movie? No, not by any stretch. Is it a fun movie? Yes, but like the rails, the bullet train goes off, mileage really may vary."
"And let's just say with all these stunts, gore and adrenaline-inducing sequences, it is hard to be bored."
"As it poorly emulates Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, the action picture ends up as a cartoonish mess and exhausting watch more than an entertaining popcorn flick."
Bullet Train employs David Leitch's maximalist style in a purposefully silly narrative driven by frenetic action and distinct humor. Every second with Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry is genuinely hilarious.
"AWESOME. The last big ride for the summer that brought back the movie theater experience for so many people & what a film to end on. Widely entertaining from top to bottom that constantly gives you laughs, action, & insanity. "
"Bullet Train is turbulent and chaotic but a thrilling ride nonetheless. Its illogical, blood-soaked premise may derail some, but others might find charm in its memorable cameos, wild hairstyles, and magnetic characters. "
Watching Brad Pitt completely flanderize into a human golden retriever who only recites self-help sayings for 2 hours and 6 minutes was insufferable.  
Bullet Train isn’t going anywhere fast. It’s self-indulgent and thinks it’s doing something entirely unique. The film gives itself far more credit than it deserves.
I used “annoyingly fun” to describe Bullet Train because I don’t know what other oxymoron can best capture the delirium that transpired in its two-hour runtime. 
"It’s a waste of an interesting premise, it drags after the first act, continues to hit new levels of monotony, and, ironically, never picks up the pace."
"Bullet Train is a mixed bag, worth seeing for action fans, but maybe at a matinee screening or when it hits VOD. There’s a tighter and better 100-minute movie in that 126-minute high-energy extravaganza..."
"With an A-list cast happily playing against type, a nonlinear storytelling approach, witty dialogue and a plethora of creative violence, Bullet Train plays out like an immensely satisfying upgrade of prime Tarantino."
A blast... The film works because Brad Pitt is a really funny and engaging guy.
"Leitch helms his action with clarity and impact, creating a beautifully nonsensical thrill ride that could have been a trainwreck, but entertains to the end of the line."
"If Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is wagyu steak, this is a juicy dive burger."
"Strangely, this murder at 320kms per hour action comedy may be an embarrassment of riches in the talent department, but the execution leaves one exhausted by the trip, impatient to find their stop."
"Without ebbs or flows to modulate the viewing experience and a never-ending barrage of increasingly ridiculous action (fun at first; exhausting by the end), Bullet Train proves that sometimes “more” is actually too much."
"Like the titular mode of transportation, it does pick up speed as it barrels along."
"Brad Pitt's comedic chops are what saves an otherwise exhausting Bullet Train. It is Pitt's incredible comedic deliveries and charisma that carry the film. He proves that, even with a poor script, he has the talent to keep the film on track. "
"With unpredictable intersecting storylines, innovative fight sequences, and a memorable cast of characters, Bullet Train is that rare action flick that doesn't skimp when it comes to delivering in the important areas that are often neglected in the genre."
"If Brad Pitt's remaining performances are numbered, I would hate like hell to think of what we missed just so that we could have this."
Not even its sensational cast can save this mildly entertaining train ride from derailment. [Full Review in Spanish]
"It’s not fatal that Leitch and company have no evident goal other than to amuse audiences with two hours of spiffy nonsense, but there’s a whiff of try-hard desperation behind the film’s bravado."
"...a relentlessly frenetic (and utterly exhausting) actioner that’s rarely, if ever, as exciting as one might’ve anticipated..."
"Is the movie trying to say something here? Something about the cruel, farcical hand of fate? Nah. But it is trying to say something: Shut up and enjoy this."
"It's supposed to Tarantino-esque, and cute, and Antoine Fuqua-riveting-action-y, and hilarious, but it's just none of the above. Miss this train."
"As an action comedy, it borrows a handful of Ritchie clichés and mixes them conventionally into a violent plot that stumbles unsurprisingly along the rails of chaos and boredom. [Full review in Spanish]"
Bullet Train is an entertaining high-octane thriller ... is guaranteed to be memorable to audiences 
"Fantasies of crime, especially unruly ones, often have ideas of order and control at their heart, a reach of power we rarely have in ordinary existence."
"It's a shortcoming when a film set on a highspeed train seems to take no strategic visual approach to presenting that velocity onscreen. ""Bullet Train"" is not lazy enough to be 'by the numbers', but it never feels aesthetically thought out or engaging."
"Unlike the best action-comedies, there is nothing breezy or light about the film; rather, it runs hard and heavy, constantly trying to impress you with its bloody mayhem."
"The film needed more of that rebellious yet natural energy instead of the “he killed my wife, I’m mad about that” vengeance diet. What could have been pretty cool ended up being very dull and forgettable."
"It’s a shame that the filmmakers didn’t trust the spatial and dramatic tensions provided by the train journey, and opted instead for seen-it-all-before spectacle."
"Not as clever and funny as it thinks it is, but the stylish action comedy is always stimulating and amusing."
"A lot of fun to watch, while the talented cast fully leans into the colorful cast of characters they’re given to work with. It’s outlandish, a little hard to believe at times, and over-the-top in a way that never falls into full blown camp."
"It’s just funny enough, just star-powered enough, just well-choreographed enough to squeak by its own shortcomings."
Bullet Train is a completely zany yet butt-kicking good time film with a fun story.
"It didn't blow me away, but I was entertained."
"Bullet Train is an exceptionally fun trip to the cinemas. Pitt gives a downright hilarious performance, reaffirming that he is one of the greats, while Henry and Taylor-Johnson give him a run for his money as the best of the film’s cast."
"Bullet Train is too cartoonish for much to be at stake and piles on the effects-heavy carnage in its final throes. Luckily, Pitt's delivery just about keeps it on track."
It delivers nothing we haven't seen before. Yet it succeeds on charisma and energy alone.
"I ended up asking myself what was more vexing in this film: the allusions to popular culture, the crass hypocrisy of an overworked plot, or the phony action sequences."
Bullet Train offers a lot to like and leaves something to be desired at the same time.
"It moves at a good pace, it is full of charismatic performances, and it is always ready to include more violence and blood and one-liners to distract the viewer. Full review in Spanish."
"We're left with a movie that doesn't bother with logic and that believes piling on more stylized action, more shallow humor, and a few cheap cameos is enough to get by. "
"While Bullet Train’s basic premise is a recipe for fun and does succeed in entertaining with pleasing action choreography, it’s never as clever as it thinks it is nor as exhilarating as it ought to be. "
"Leaves a lot on the table with this concept, but no one can pull off a bucket hat like Brad Pitt."
"The twisty, more-smug-than-clever plot doesn’t really matter, the fun and the guns and the odd celebrity cameo and gruesome death do."
"Bullet Train is a thrill ride of excitement, action, and comedy. The cast complements each other with their wit and sarcasm and then duke it out in some awesome fight sequences."
"An ostensible action film that is so light on well-crafted fights one hesitates to even classify it as such, Bullet Train can best be described as a low-rent Quentin Tarantino imitation though without anything of its own to stand on."
It doesn’t work as an action movie any better than it works as a comedy.
Bullet Train is a patchwork quilt of bombastic ideas put together with a dodgy sewing machine.
Bullet Train has its moments -- Leitch's action bonafides are still definitely on display -- but it's sadly a step down after the remarkable Atomic Blonde.
The cast is top-notch. It’s fun to see Pitt playing somewhat against type with all his moments of self-doubt and angst over being pressed into fighting and killing instead of “talking it out”.
"Bullet Train has its heart in the rate place because it just wants to offer viewers a fun time at the movies. A big screen, fast-paced, fun, darkly comic, and relentlessly overstuffed adventure movie to entertain the masses."
"Entertaining, eye-catching, witty, comedic, and just over-the-top creative."
"There's a glib amorality about this action farce, but Pitt is funny as a philosophical self-help-reading dude-bro assassin."
"Brad Pitt should be the perfect actor for this comedy adventure on a speeding train, but he doesn't bring enough charm to keep this train running."
"If he wants it, Pitt finally has his franchise. It’s ruthless, cleverly bloody and filled with David Leitch’s Atomic Blonde violent choreography. Mega-star Pitt lets co-star Taylor-Johnson display all the movie’s sex in an expensive suit."
"While you can detect a lot of hard work, it still results in a strange strain of overall blandness."
... basically a fun but predictable video game.
"It’s a fun ride to be sure, but an uneven one that nearly squanders such a talented ensemble."
"Don’t let the glossy trailers fool you — Brad Pitt’s new action comedy, Bullet Train, is a strenuous and leaden film that never takes off."
A fun movie that was just one script element and one plot point too much for itself.
"Sure it is a little long and sometimes a little too cute for its own good, but ultimately it delivers on exactly what it sets out to do -- giving the audience a blood-soaked good time with a lot of laughs mixed in."
"Even though Bullet Train mistakes style for substance, it has the good sense to look awesome."
"“Bullet Train” has a story to tell, but director David Leitch, a former stuntman for Pitt, Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Matt Damon, tells it in slapdash fashion. Much of the material is played for laughs, but little of it is actually humorous. "
What it turns out to be is an odd assortment of subplots and flashbacks which disrupt the flow of the main story.
"Coupling humor with foul language and splatter-gore violence isn’t a new technique, but Bullet Train tries to convince you that it’s doing something fresh with its large ensemble cast."
"I will not use the term “train wreck.” But by the end, the joke is on anyone who was looking for something more than a wild ride."
"Though not without its controversy, the film is an enjoyable romp to sit down and take all in for its outrageous action and over-the-top story."
The largely entertaining action flick Bullet Train rolls along on the power of Brad Pitt’s megawatt charisma – and sometimes on that alone.
Bullet Train is a brainless action movie that the star-studded cast can’t save.
"There are some attempts at intrigue, the now requisite random A-list cameos, and some genuine comedy from Pitt, mostly."
"This film is a cartoonish action-comedy, superimposed on a super gross and grisly backdrop even Pitt and the rest of the cast can’t save. This Bullet Train goes off the rails as a fast trip to nowhere. "
"Bullet Train certainly serves the Brad Pitt brand, but it’s too weak to deliver him to a new destination."
"This was a nice change of pace from movies that want you to think about stuff. Bullet Train lets you not think about stuff, and then gently reminds you of the stuff you do need to remember"
Bullet Train is deft enough to give each confrontation stakes and each character their time to shine.
"Super-quick, hyper-quirky, cartoonishly violent and garishly good-looking, this comedy-action flick works as idiotic fun but ultimately self-sabotages by trying too hard to be clever."
"Witty mayhem is unleashed in this action comedy...While there are enough ridiculous character details and throwaway gags to keep us chuckling, director David Leitch ironically struggles to build momentum."
"At a certain point, the joke is that Bullet Train is The Cannonball Run on a bullet train."
"Worse, the film seldom takes advantage of its setting. For most of the caper, this could have been a door-slamming farce set just about anywhere, like a hotel..."
Bullet Train provides a breezy dose of summer movie entertainment despite its turbulent inconsistencies. 
Bullet Train is a pleasant surprise in more ways than one.  [Full review in Spanish] 
"Though the dialogue has few laughs, the acting and humorously complex story make it worth a train ticket. "
"With a whitewashed and underused cast [...] and humour that needed more time in the oven, Bullet Train fails most of its accompaniments. And [David] Leitch has shown that he doesn't know what makes good action for the third time in a row."
"This film adaptation, by screenwriter Zak Olkewicz, is a blessing and a curse. It creates, builds and lights the fuse on this Molotov cocktail. But the script’s overabundance of characters, dips in momentum and protracted ending don’t help."
"Watching Bullet Train, one thing came to mind: fun. The actors look to be having a blast, and the many laughs rolling through my small screening showed the audience having just as much fun. This movie is a big, bold action comedy that pulls no punches"
It’s nice to know that Chad Stahelski was the true mastermind behind the first John Wick flick and not Leitch.
"... Often good fun but there's a sense of smugness about it, as if the audience is being invited to share in a private joke being told by the filmmakers, that makes it a slightly wearying experience at times. "
"Wants to be wittier than it is but it hardly matters, it entertains and demonstrates that it can play better than almost any Marvel movie with similar ingredients. [Full review in Spanish]"
"With its colourful but two-dimensional cast and constant flashbacks alongside shock reveals, this surprisingly talky film comes off as a salute to Guy Ritchie and Tarantino imitators, only with a more flamboyant approach to murder."
"While some will detest this sort of rambunctious, frenzied, in-your-face mayhem, many fans of the genre will join me in enthusiastically screaming, “shoot this into my veins!”"
"It's off the rails, in a mostly good way."
"The inspired premise of Bullet Train and the game ensemble cast holds lots of opportunities to make a wholly enjoyable film. However, the undisciplined filmmaking and shoddy script brings the film to a complete stop."
"Bullet Train is a perfect example of style over substance. You’ll enjoy it as you watch it, then the memory will zoom away minutes later. "
Bullet Train is ultimately an overly generic and dated blockbuster beneath a shiny veneer that feels like a small fraction of the film it could have been.
"Hard as he may try, Brad Pitt does not have enough backing from the screenplay to pull off a miracle and prevent the ride from running aground."
"Leitch gets more than half way to his destination, not a disaster but less than a triumph for a movie that seems to have big-time summer box-office ambitions."
"Director Taika Waititi successfully juggles the comic and the tragic in Marvel Studios’ “Thor: Love and Thunder."""
"The story does a fantastic job of giving us new aspects to explore with Thor; not as a god, but as a hero."
"There’s enough meat on the bones for the film to provide middling entertainment, but it’s a shame Waititi seemed to have so little to really flesh the movie out."
In a deft twist on class war – the gods bleed gold – Thor must confront his privilege and make amends for other gods’ failures to keep promises.
"Despite its great acting, score and worldbuilding and epic character moments, Thor: Love and Thunder feels like one continuous joke that doesn’t land."
"No spark or brio in its romantic affairs or CGI-filled action sequences... frustratingly one-note comedic panderings undercut any attempt at developing an emotional story arc.

"
"A bittersweet story about finding peace and love in suffering and pain, without forgetting the necessary thunderous action that reaches its best level in a long sequence surrounded by a breathtaking black-and-white color palette."
Romantic action comedy you need this summer! An action packed hilarious but also poignant film on change! Taika Wrote a wonderful story that I just fell head over heels for!
The film’s final scene explains the rationale for the film’s title and shows a glimpse of a different path Love and Thunder could’ve taken. A path that would have been more fit for Waititi’s vision of an 80s romance adventure hijinks-filled movie.
"Thor: Love and Thunder is gorgeously shot, chaotically executed, tonally inconsistent at times, and yet a joy ride even when it pushes deeper into the cruelties of life. "
"Thor Love and Thunder is one of the worst movies of the year. From the first frame to the last, it’s unengaging, insipid, and tedious."
"With one of the shortest runtimes we’ve seen from Marvel in a while at only 119 mins, the much-awaited Thor: Love and Thunder is the definition of here for a good time, not a long time! "
"There may be thunder, but lightning does not strike twice."
"Therein lies Thor: Love and Thunder‘s biggest issue, its inability to balance tone and spectacle."
"Thor: Love and Thunder's editing routinely works against Taika Waititi's film, often undoing the emotional work the film is attempting to deliver."
"Taika Waititi and Chris Hemsworth leaned heavily into the more goofy aspects of Thor: Ragnarok. Thor: Love and Thunder piles on the jokes, bathos and stupidity until the film feels more like a parody of the MCU rather an addition to it."
"I’m laying down the hammer a bit more harshly because somewhere hidden in this messy pastiche to 80s fantasy movies is an adventure worthy of the gods. Unfortunately, hilarity and humanity fail to harmonize in Thor: Love and Thunder."
Overall a fun time but not the big blockbuster some might be expecting and certainly not recommended if you didn’t find Ragnarok very funny…
"Hemsworth has always been likeable as the smug superhero-god with the Adonis-like physique to match, but the risky attempt to transfer that charisma or to spread it around to other characters is not a gamble that pays off."
"'Love and Thunder' will remind you of fantastical adventure films like The Neverending Story, where the impossible can happen. At the same time, it may get in its own way trying to tackle as much as it does."
"It's bonkers in the best possible way. It's silly, laugh-out-loud funny and never takes itself too seriously. For those who have been living on a steady diet of Marvel films, this one delivers hilarious one-liners, jabs and Easter eggs.  "
"In Love and Thunder, Waititi pulls off a sneaky, deeply cool move—one that'll likely go unappreciated."
Proves to be more spoof than smash.
"Waititi seems driven to tell a story about Gorr and Jane Foster, allowing Christian Bale and Natalie Portman to outshine their peers. Bale simply outclasses the rest of the cast, appearing obscenely menacing and haunted by grief."
"Years after ""Ragnarök"", Waititi seems stuck in a facsimile of that same register to diminishing returns. What was previously fresh air has grown stale and “Love and Thunder"" more dull and and unspectacular. Not quite godlike."
"As a huge fan of Thor: Ragnarök, this film left me bitterly disappointed and to be honest, quite heartbroken since I had such high hopes for it."
Why should we feel anything when clearly none of it matters?
What's missing is any freaking hint as to where all this is going. <i>Love and Thunder</i> is the sixth (sixth!) movie in Phase Four of the MCU and we still don't know what the endgame (no pun intended) is. 
"I not only think that this is the worst Taika Waititi's movie, but also one that occupies a privileged place at the top of the Olympus of the most boring of the MCU. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Taika Waititi's Thor Love and Thunder was a disappointment of godlike proportions, featuring a villain that deserved a much better film."
"What makes the film durable and winning is the rare blend of comedy and serious drama weight, which is pushed through by a game cast. "
"As visually memorable as the sequence can be, narratively, it’s wet spaghetti flung at the plaster and wacky-wallwalking its way to the floor."
"... Not just the best Marvel movie yet made, but a bona fide camp comedy classic: fast, bright, gaudy, prickly, antic and fun. "
It brings up a lot of interesting ideas and ultimately does almost nothing with them.
"A refreshing venture back to what the MCU is best at delivering: summer popcorn films. You get exactly what you expect: two hours of laughs, colorful scenery, and thunderous joy."
"Hilarious, irreverent and full of crowd pleasing moments. However, there are moments where the story development suffers in favor of the humor, and ultimately the fourth film is not quite as strong as Ragnarok"
Thor: Love and Thunder is merely a subpar love story meshed within a subpar superhero action movie.
Oh how the mighty have fallen! Taika Waititi was clearly given significantly more freedom here and it is not a good result. The slapstick comedy is way too frequent and makes the film feel like a spoof of it's own characters. It's dumb fun...but not much.
"Here’s the thing about Thor: Love and Thunder, the fourth solo outing for the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s God of Thunder: pretty much every individual element works on its own, and almost none of it works taken as a whole. "
"This is not an action film with humor, this is a comedy with action. Don't take it too seriously and you'll have a lovely time. Russell Crowe knocks it out of the park."
They should have simply let James Gunn play with Thor in Guardians 3 and given Jane Foster her own Mighty Thor film so as not to relegate her into footnote status. Thank goodness for Bale. [His] grief’s authenticity proves how superficial the rest is.
"Thor: Love and Thunder is lacking in both love and thunder, and could have used more dramatic tension and more palpable, affecting stakes."
"The jokes, the catch-phrases, just incredibly tired..."
"Thor: Love and Thunder had a great opportunity with Portman as the new Thor & Bale as the God Killer but they were under utilized. At times this was downright silly, visual effects were not well done, & this was one my least favorite Marvel films to date"
I love me some Taika Waititi!  The Oscar-winning filmmaker has a perfect touch when balancing drama and humor.  And that touch is on full display in “THOR: Love and Thunder.”
A silly new Thor.
"There’s dry wit throughout this movie, but also a sense of unearned familiarity. "
The resulting tone is so sloppily winking and unserious that it feels grotesque.
"I'll say this about Thor: Love and Thunder, it tries a little of everything. Unfortunately it results in a pretty disappointing mess. "
Hemsworth is a dream - he really understands his own strengths as a performer and as a thing to be objectified.
The idea that Waititi has made the Thor films throwaway comedic fluff is nonsense.
"Is Thor: Love and Thunder a bad film? I don’t know, but maybe it’s time to reevaluate 2013’s Thor: The Dark World as the franchise’s weakest entry…"
"There's plenty of great ideas here, but the movie plays too much as a comedy to take any of it seriously."
"""I feel like this movie was the maturation of Thor because you saw and understood why he went through his depressive states in Infinity War/Endgame. As the movie progresses you see that his happiness is truly based on the love he has missed."" Naturally Na"
I thought it was fun but it definitely was way too silly to take the Gorr storyline more seriously. I wish we had seen more of Gorr actually butchering gods. 
This felt like a chore to get through it. Cinematography was the best aspect of this film. The humor got redundant very quickly...
Thor: Love and Thunder is both a classic Thor adventure and a middle-age crisis comedy (if that exists within the context of a god's lifespan). [Full review in Spanish]
"Falling short in giving real weight to any threats to overcome, the fifth Thor film settles into a story about love, loss, and sacrifice that every viewer can relate to while still wallowing in mandatory spectacle. "
"Too much to handle in less than two hours and feels simultaneously lazier and more overwrought than earlier entries, but an effective escapist event nonetheless."
This Thor flick is the compendium of all things that should not be done when it comes to superhero movies.
"Many critics have noted the bloodlessness and sexlessness of the MCU. Thor: Love and Thunder seems self-conscious about the latter, while doing little to change it."
Yawn.
One of the best MCU films yet.
"Taika Waititi seems to think he can carry us through a ludicrous story on the strength of a performative comedian’s confidence alone, but it’s just too transparent."
It seems to be trying hard and only succeeding part of the time. It could be Waititi is just getting tired.
"The egregious storyline given to Natalie Portman’s Dr. Jane Foster in “Thor: Love and Thunder” is the latest example of the MCU doing its heroines so, so wrong."
Love and Thunder trips over its ambitions in a bloated and conceptually underbaked sequel.
It’s the pure heart of Thor—and Thor—and their story that saves Thor: Love and Thunder from its own excesses.
"Thor: Love and Thunder is a solid addition to the MCU, filled with laughs and thrills, but it ironically struggles with its villain and identity, just as Thor seems to."
Waititi recreates an adventure with the logic of a Monty Python parody in the world of superheroes. [Full review in Spanish]
"Despite its ample faults, the film nevertheless earns a modest recommendation, albeit one with more reservations than beachfront hotels during Spring Break."
"Thor: Love and Thunder contains that same vigor Waititi brought to Thor: Ragnarok, creating a film that’s a visually stunning blast with ‘80s rock flavor. However, its biggest flaw is the overuse of his schtick in trying to recreate Ragnarok's success."
"One of the most shockingly erratic, all-over-the-place movies that Marvel Studios has ever produced."
"It doesn’t always succeed, but while it never quite lives up to the power of its predecessor, Thor’s fourth solo outing does it at least remind you why you love the guy in the first place, and makes you glad he stuck around this long. "
"While not the worst Thor film, Love & Thunder has a lot of potential in its fantasy adventure but rarely rises to become a worthy sequel to its superior predecessor."
"A simple plot, but it has the e elements to make it entertaining, and a fast pace so that it is not tedious.  [Full review in Spanish] "
"Ending on a sweet note, Thor Love and Thunder delivers the visual spectacle fans will be hoping for and, in Portman, another fantastic female hero. However, all the hair metal in the galaxy can’t disguise a franchise that has begun to repeat itself. "
"For a movie seemingly made with the sole purpose of inserting as many goofy gags per minute as possible while employing a healthy dose of vivid colors and rousing GNR hits, Love and Thunder is shockingly lethargic. "
"It is a love story about selfishness versus selflessness. The struggle between these two impulses is the very same struggle that is at the heart of what is going on in America, and the rest of the world. It could hardly be more relevant."
"...segues into a predictably overstuffed narrative that contains far too many larger-than-life, special-effects-heavy action interludes..."
"Despite its inconsistencies throughout, Love and Thunder still crackles with enough verve and energy to remain an entertaining addition to the franchise even if it doesn’t feel as vital."
"Taika Waititi’s “Thor: Love and Thunder” is a triumph to behold, staying true to the tongue-in-cheek humor with solid themes of love and family—it’s one of Marvel’s strongest films to date."
It's the seafood extender of Marvel movies.
"A grandiloquent goof...  Tee-hee, giggle-giggle from the get-go, and that’s all right: Taika Waititi is the filmmaker most disrespectful of the goings-on in the self-serious, overstuffed conversation pit of the larger Marvel Comic Universe. "
"While satisfying viewing experiences are subjective and dependent on the individual watching, the stylistic risks and occasionally relatively daring tonal departures should be a welcome guest for all viewers."
"I think it's a good MCU film. It's different, it's wild, it's crazy, and I liked it."
[Portman] is engaging and credible in her action scenes. She seems to be having fun and it is fun to watch her.
"Thor is not a perfect film, but for me, it was the perfect two hours my cinematic soul wanted and needed."
"For those expecting a grandiose story with stakes as equal to Thor: Ragnarok, this movie will fall short, but if you go in just expecting an enjoyable film that the family can laugh along with, then this film will certainly deliver."
"Love and Thunder flies off in multiple plot directions, never quite making any one of them feel complete. The end result is enjoyable to watch because the characters are such good company, but the story’s a mess."
It’s more Pirates of the Caribbean than a Marvel spinoff. There are visually splendorous set pieces...
"New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi's second silly-scary, action-packed addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"... what it manages is a solidly entertaining and fun, if too goofy, Marvel adventure that won’t count among the studios best but is still satisfying enough for cinematic summer escapism."
Taika keeps these Thor movies from being a depressing slog with tons of color and humor.
The film passes through the nervous system without delivering any sustenance or even leaving a residue.
It's not as mighty as 'Ragnarock.'
"The best movie out of Marvel Studios in the last two years, the most fun and ingenious since the first Guardians of the Galaxy, and certainly the best cinematic offer from the titular protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]"
Scene after scene of potential gravitas is undercut by Waititi’s need to remind us at every turn how clever he is.
"The film is an aesthetic and storytelling mess from beginning to end, never knowing exactly what it wants to achieve while hindering most of its emotionally investing moments in favor of unfunny and irritating jokes."
"hor: Love and Thunder is an action-packed rip-ride of a marvel flick, whose clunky exposition isn’t enough to detract from the heartfelt central story and the (long overdue) focus on Jane Foster."
"Their group dynamic needs to figure out how to better distinguish their personas, but they’re also generous in sharing the screen. The funniest role they’ve written here goes to Meg Stalter as a deluded park ranger."
"Unfortunately, Please Don't Destroy's first feature-length film offers a painfully predictable story and fails to elicit almost any laughs."
"Maybe this film is destined to be a cult classic, or maybe it will be relegated to more streaming platform filler."
"There are some laugh-out-loud moments you won’t be able to resist, but it just gets sloppy in the end"
"[Please Don't Destroy: The Legend of Foggy Mountain] is awkward, ridiculous fun from some fresh voices, and the best SNL-produced comedy to come along in decades. "
"I mostly found myself giggling through the movie, and I think that’s as much as the creators could hope for from someone who enjoys Please Don’t Destroy in small doses on SNL but isn’t sure their sensibilities translate into a feature film."
...an entertaining-enough debut for a trio of exceedingly promising comedy stars.
"If anything, it feels apt to refer to The Treasure of Foggy Mountain as their “not ready for primetime” attempt to deliver a feature capitalizing off their chemistry and sense of humor."
"With Please Don't Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain, they toe the line between teen boy humor (fart jokes, vulgar sexual references) and genuine messages about friendship and manhood. "
"With their uneven feature vehicle Please Don’t Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain, the three decamp to small-town North Carolina as doofuses far outside showbiz, though “Ben,” “Martin,” and “John” remain suspended in a state of arrested adolescence."
"“The Treasure of Foggy Mountain,” while having its share of laugh-out-loud moments and trademark bizarre humor, is primarily a lifeless mess, just not really connecting in any meaningful way and often just too silly to function in a movie form."
"Please Don’t Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain has way more laughs than the standard direct-to-streaming comedy, with some gloriously silly running gags and hilarious non sequiturs. But it lacks any real point of view behind that silliness."
The movie fully embraces how much fun it is to watch people who understand each other on a molecular level.
"While there are plenty of laughs along the trio’s journey, PDD reminds us why it’s been over a decade since the last SNL feature-length project. "
"There’s obviously some talent at work here, but not much in the way of stretching, and the initial energy and sheer dorkiness doesn’t generate enough laughs to sustain a movie."
"With incredible performances, high-quality jokes, and ambitious production, the movie is a worthwhile adventure that centers on the value of friendship. In the end, you’re bound to be craving more from the comedy trio!"
This one is more forgettable than it could have been but also nowhere near the disaster that often comes when members of Lorne Michaels' troupe are allowed out during the day.
"The comedy Please Don't Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain is a hit-or-miss affair, but one that hits slightly more than it misses.
"
"Ultimately, that's what The Treasure of Foggy Mountain is: pure dumb fun, albeit with some awkward dead spots. "
"Sketch comedy tends to work because you don’t have to spend more than a few minutes at a time with exaggerated caricatures of human beings. This type of humor rarely translates well in a full feature, and this film is proof of that. "
"A strong feature-length debut for Please Don’t Destroy, mostly proving they can handle the run time and remain fresh with their comedic targets, and their high-energy, good-natured nonsense is great fun to watch.
"
Can an act who does their best work in two-minute bursts hold our attention for an hour and a half? Sort of. 
I don’t know how long the boys can keep tapping the well of their surreal imaginations before they become exhausting. But I do know that The Treasure of Foggy Mountain made me laugh so hard I missed a number of jokes.
A diverting enough entertainment from a group that has repeatedly proven itself to be capable of much more.
"The frustrating thing is that Marshall, Herlihy and especially Higgins really are funny, and the film has some huge laughs. That’s enough for a sketch show. It’s not quite enough for a film."
"As comedy writers and movie actors, the members of Please Don’t Destroy – Martin Herlihy, John Higgins and Ben Marshall – are out of their depth."
"Alas, the comedic momentum and near-absurd energy don't last..."
"“‘The Treasure of Foggy Mountain’ doesn’t match the quality of mid-level Adam Sandler comedies, but it just may work as a double-billing with Akiva Schaffer’s 2007 film ‘Hot Rod’ starring Andy Samberg…”"
"Please Don't Destroy's debut film isn't necessarily a treasure, but there are a few gems to make the future look solid for this trio."
"The first act of the Paul Briganti-directed feature succeeds in large part to this easygoing dynamic. Once the story stretches, the thinness of its premise shows through and writing goes from loose to sloppy, charming to grating."
"While the group’s short SNL videos are often quite amusing, this feature-length venture doesn’t do them any favors."
"“Leave the World Behind” showcases the things society takes for granted while also offering insightful commentary on conspiracy theories, perceptions of race, and political turmoil. 
"
"A perfectly cast film that doesn’t skip a beat. Leave the World Behind offers a stellar mix of thrills, unsettling ideas and pitch perfect laughs that amount to a wildly riveting watch, one that will weigh heavily on minds after the credits."
"Although at times it seems to veer into its own uncertain logic which yields moments of confusion, Leave the World Behind will undoubtedly lead to passionate debates about the futuristic implications it proposes. [Full review in Spanish]"
Leave the World Behind had a brilliantly squirmy premise that was swiftly squandered on a routine end-of-the world plot filleted from Stephen King door-stoppers like Under the Dome and The Stand.
"The acting is first rate and it needs to be -- this is a drama of manners and secrets, and each sigh or glance reveals so much. We haven’t seen a nasty Roberts character in a while and Ali balances sophistication and slyness artfully. "
A wickedly well-crafted piece of pressure-cooker psychology and perhaps not purely speculative havoc.
"Despite a highly capable cast that plays each thematic note on cue, Leave the World Behind buckles under the weight of its expanding scale and its many malformed ideas. "
"The better version of ""Leave the World Behind"" might not even need to be more of a taut thriller that gets to the finish line while viewers are still engaged with the mystery — it would just need to have the courage of its B-movie convictions."
... Almost always interesting and at times straightforwardly devastating. [Full review in Spanish]
"Leave the World Behind is a smart, compelling take on the end of the world, and proves Esmail is a writer-director who deserves larger-scale projects like this after his television successes. "
"Making crafty use of editing, music, and composition, this pessimistic thriller is more about human flaws than anything thrilling, but it's so well made that it easily catches us in its grip."
You should be trying to puzzle out what it all can possibly mean. But after awhile you stop asking and just wait for the next expertly administered jolt.
"Oh no—not another doomsday thriller! Yes, but  see how director Sam Esmail, powered by an exceptional all-star cast (Julia Roberts, Ethan Hawke, Mahershala Ali, Kevin Bacon), makes you care about being human while frying your nerves to a frazzle."
"Has some dazzling moments, but it's also too long, and loses steam in the last act."
It suffers from trying to do too many things... But on the whole it's a cut above the sort of films Shyamalan has been trying to do lately. 
"A pretty playful and taut thriller that's very small but trying to cram in a bunch of ideas about paranoia, class, misanthropy and the dependence of people on the internet. "
"Leave the World Behind might often have the air of a noughties throwback, but you wouldn’t want it to be a minute more up to date."
"An impressively unnerving film with things to say about race, tech and conspiracy theories."
Leave the World Behind is not especially original; there are too many other apocalyptic movies around for that. But the film... is especially timely. 
"Blinded by its own shiny smugness, you may want to leave this film behind."
"A mean, nasty, and cynical apocalyptic parable that stages the quintessential end of the world scenario..."
The performances are flawless and the shooting style sensational.
Sam Esmail presents some spectacular images but the film is at least 25 minutes too long. A Quiet Place (2018) covered broadly similar territory much more deftly.
"Dizzying shots signal twists of fate and shifts in the order of things, while some bravura special effects work allows the camera to seamlessly traverse walls and floors in the elaborate abode."
"Expertly directly and acted, Leave the World Behind (based on the novel by Rumaan Alam) wastes no time getting you in, and then getting on your nerves."
Leave the World Behind is an addictive parlour game and a chewy treatise on human behaviour. 
"A provocative, superbly acted action drama that combines big-hitting ambition and spectacle with just enough humour to temper the whole end-of-civilisation meltdown scenario."
"For more than two hours, we are completely immersed in the filmmaker’s compelling and deeply studied world of dread. It’s unfortunate, then, that the film’s conclusion feels too easy and abrupt..."
Very often writer-director Sam Esmail will split the dramatic focus between two or even three different crises within the ensemble and the effect is a little self-cancelling. And then …?
Misanthropy can only carry the movie so far before it gets old.
Hang on. A great end of the world thriller.
"While Leave the World Behind can be too on-the-nose at times, it never fails to be an engrossing and chilling look at a doomsday that we can’t help but catapult ourselves towards."
Leave the World Behind feels like what you would get if you took this year’s Knock at the Cabin and knocked the Shyamalan out of it.
"Viewers have seen films like Leave the World Behind before, but rarely done to such an accomplished and reasoned degree."
"Leave the World Behind is blinded by its own smugness, fancying itself privy to the secrets of the human condition."
"“Leave the World Behind” is the unusual case of a film that starts out bad and gets better. So, if you find that you’re already enjoying yourself, stick with it, because it definitely won’t get any worse."
"Esmail’s sophomore feature is akin to sci-fi blockbusters of yesteryear with a light, practically Spielbergian touch and sense of adventure."
"Esmail’s characters are blinded by a different kind of bourgeois comfort food, one that only comes into focus in the film’s final, biting, and deeply satisfying sequence."
"If nothing else, the film is both well-acted and well-crafted."
"Never had I watched a movie where I shook my head and said, “White people…” so many times. It was a shared sentiment."
“Leave the World Behind” enters the stage as one of the year’s best and no doubt will spark massive amounts of conversation. 
"Leave the World Behind is destined to be a movie lost in the void of a streaming service that will premiere better, more complex pieces of entertainment shortly after it releases, thus rendering this pointless exercise obsolete."
"Unquestionably, for whatever genre you want to place it in, Leave the World Behind has much to say about the tenuous state of our current planet and the freewheeling technology on which we increasingly rely but which also threatens to consume us."
The film is able to turn what might literally be the end of the world into a gripping stage play because the four adults are so well-written. Ali steals the show as George.
"And clocking in at 138 minutes, the film’s pace is leisurely (to say the least) where it has to be tight, leaving “Leave the World Behind” in a kind of no man’s land — too talky to work as a genre film and too ham-handed to offer real insight."
"This film feels like a more satisfying version of the not-dissimilarly apocalyptic, but ultimately preposterous “Knock at the Cabin” from earlier this year"
"Razor sharp dialogue, direction and performances from Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke and Mya'la make this psychologically impactful thriller a triumph"
"Fine performances help to bolster a problematic picture written and directed by Sam Esmail, adapted from Rumaan Alam’s best-selling novel."
"A confident, entertaining thriller about two families forced to live together in the middle of nowhere as civilization collapses around them."
"Cocaine Bear is a great bad idea, the kind that happens at 3am after too many edibles, and then you wake up two days later and find you've written a script in a fever dream you don't remember, and the script is Cocaine Bear, and it's not bad..."
"Chances are if the premise of a film is its best joke, then it is not going to be a particularly great film."
"While I can’t stress enough that this script feels messy, parts of the production make us root for the finished product despite ourselves. We knew going in this felt like a skit being stretched into a movie."
"Cocaine Bear delivers precisely what it promised: an absolutely insane bear wreaking bloody, gory, visually shocking havoc while committing unimaginably ridiculous actions."
"""Cocaine Bear"" delights in its own dysfunction and unapologetically revels in it for 90 minutes straight."
"Obviously, this isn't a film for kids or people who can't handle seeing lots of blood on the screen. But for everyone else, ""Cocaine Bear"" is just a fun time that packs in several laughs through its absurd and welcome violence."
"Cocaine Bear is a bear doing cocaine for about 75 percent of the film & then murdering stupid people. The kills, the murder, the blood , are all fun but there’s quite a few dull moments that hold the film back. 

An overly long SNL skit"
Cocaine Bear makes little attempt to be a movie; it’s more a bunch of random scenes strung together with the hope of making people laugh and guffaw.
"As someone who grew up in rural Appalachia during the height of the Reagan era, I can attest that bundles of drugs regularly fell from the sky."
"Cocaine Bear will, in time, stand as a dated artifact of the current moment's vogue for viral animal videos and epic memes."
"On the pantheon of movies about animals doing drugs, Cocaine Bear ranges somewhere above Bachelor Party (RIP, sex donkey) and somewhere below Fritz the Cat, take that endorsement as you will."
"Banks is a competent director, but her humour doesn’t have the dark edge the material calls for – imagine the twisted fun a Sam Raimi or Dead Snow’s Tommy Wirkola could have with a concept like this."
It should be pretty clear from the outset whether or not this is your sort of film.
"In the end, there is a half-assed setup for a sequel, but since they never made Snakes on a Plane 2 (which I could have gotten behind), Cocaine Bear may not prove as lasting as the real bear that inspired it."
"A film that believes it is taking us right up to the edge in bad taste comedy and violence. The problem is once it believes it has gotten to that edge, it just stares off into the distance along with us wondering where the laughs and terror will arrive."
Knows exactly what it is without striving for more or wearing out its welcome.
"Elizabeth Banks tosses in all the gratuitous severed legs and dripping blood you could ask for in a horror movie, but it’s not really a horror movie. It's the kind of deftly timed physical comedy you don’t see that much on the big screen any more."
Wouldn't expect anything less from a far fetched based on true events movie about a bear going on a full cocaine rampage in the 80s. The ambulance chasing scene is Oscar clip material.
"A cocktail that mixes blood with guts, black humour, lots of swear words (several of them uttered by the children) and a drugged bear, to develop an experience that will make you laugh and cringe (sometimes at the same time). Full review in Spanish."
"A movie called Cocaine Bear should not go easy on the outrageousness, but after a promising start, the film settles into a comfortable and safe groove."
"“Cocaine Bear” reaches a point of diminishing returns, where everyone involved —onscreen, behind the camera and in the audience — realizes there’s not as much material here as was needed to fill 90-or-so minutes."
"Y’all know I was expecting a LOT of splatter, and I was not disappointed. The body count is high, the limbs are flying, there’s a really juicy brain shot, and praise be for all the practical F/X! "
'Cocaine Bear' is a disappointment to those who know what's better. All the pieces are here. It just didn't know how to shred them and make them ooze with the joy the movie promised.
Cocaine Bear makes for a very fun time. Horror fans will love to see the incredible kills and gore on display. This alone makes Cocaine Bear worth the price of admission. 
Banks has baked a very entertaining and rather ingenious piece 
Cocaine Bear is pure vice: a cartoon on speed (think Yogi Bear in South Park)... [Full review in Spanish]
The many protagonists are at fault for the film's creative stasis: they walk like cartoon characters lacking charisma and motivation. [Full review in Spanish]
Silly and contrived action-comedy caper....
The approach required a director who had more love and respect for the B movie concept.  [Full review in Spanish].
"This is not a great horror film, but it is a fun one if seen in a crowded movie theater with people having a rip-snorting good time screaming at the insanity. The film succeeds in its own way and certainly delivers on the horror side of the equation. "
"While I wish there was more time with the bear and less time with the very large cast, but it still just barely delivered enough schlocky fun to keep me entertained for 90 minutes."
"The problem with high-concept movies -- which premise you can explain in a single tweet -- is that once you present the concept on-screen, the only place to go is down. [Full review in Spanish]"
The encounters between the black bear and the characters border on parody. [Full review in Spanish]
"With a solid cast fully aware of the film’s mission, an over-the-top script with one foot in reality, and a truckload of gory special effects, Cocaine Bear proves to be much more than the sum of its parts."
"Break out the mirrors and dollar bills because Cocaine Bear is one party you won’t want to miss.

"
"Of course, if one comes to Cocaine Bear with low expectations and with a playful demeanor the experience can be pleasant, at least for a while... [Full review in Spanish]"
Cocaine Bear is a fun movie that works due to its impartial spirit and delirious sense of humor. 
"The objective of the film is, certainly, to offer us fun and a good dose of blood.  [Full review in Spanish] "
"The tone is a very tricky needle to thread, but Banks does it. "
"Cocaine Bear isn't anything more than a desperate offering, trying to fill the void at the beginning of the year... [Full review in Spanish]"
"More fluff than fur, Cocaine Bear lacks bite. It’s more like cocaine bore.
"
"Makes the best of its premise and cast, pitting 15 good actors against a coked-up bear. "
"Despite a few laughs and a couple of well-executed sequences, its wacky premise wears off rather quickly. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"It would benefit from being a lot more silly, a lot more of the time."
"Cocaine Bear is as fun as it is scattershot. Full of great moments that shine separately, but that don't achieve a good cohesion between them. [Full review in Spanish] "
"Using vivid imaginations, writer Warden and director Banks send their pretend bear on a rampage..."
"Cocaine Bear betrays its invitation to excess and title's luster with a puritanism that, ironically, matches the biggest flaw of Banks' movie: superficiality. [Full review in Spanish]"
"What I liked about this movie is that it was gory, it was unpredictable, I didn't even know who was going to live or die, and that always makes it more entertaining. 
"
"Cocaine Bear has no style, no suspense, no functional comedy."
"It’s no “Snakes on a Plane,” but “Cocaine Bear” takes high-concept to another level and proves nothing is too outrageous for audiences desperate to laugh."
Easily the best movie I've ever seen featuring a bear consuming a metric ton of cocaine. EASILY. Paddington could never. 
"It promises to be lawless, is what I'm saying, and very quickly shows itself to be entirely uninterested in transgressing boundaries."
"Ultimately, Jimmy Warden's script runs out of steam, but as Liotta and co grapple gamely with their furry adversary, they show the fun you can have by combining a B-movie concept with A-grade talent."
"The whole thing feels like a half-hearted goof, a term paper on the real-life ""cocaine bear"" incident written by a kid who got bored of consulting Wikipedia and started making stuff up."
"Cocaine Bear delivers the goods that the trailer promised. That will be enough for some, but unlikely to give it the cult status it aspires to. "
"It’s a mix of creative, slasher-style kills, offbeat humour, and a CGI bear that comes closer than most VFX beasts in terms of being both believable and giddily terrifying."
For the few happy stoners who loved Strange Wilderness....
"Director Elizabeth Banks has made a fast, fun, and gory as hell time at the movies. Better yet, she’s done so with genuine skill and creativity. "
"The film feels increasingly slipshod, as if everyone thought that the silly concept alone would do most of the work for them."
This is a movie that makes no apologies for trying to make you howl in laughter and disgust – at the same time.
"It was funny, it didn’t take itself too seriously, it had a short runtime of an hour and a half and it packed those ninety minutes with laughs and shocks and gore and somehow even family and heart. You need to see this movie."
"Elizabeth Banks did herself proud directing this goofy, gory but funny movie."
"Elizabeth Banks knows the type of movie she is making and when the bear is onscreen committing carnage, it works. Unfortunately, most of the movie focuses on the dull and uninteresting human characters that deliver increasingly unfunny dialogue."
"This movie isn’t bad, but its title will retain golden pop-culture-reference status long after everyone has forgotten the details of these 95 passably-amusing minutes."
"You have to admire the commitment to making a story like this into a feature film. With that, the unhinged nature of it doesn’t fill out all the crevices it hopes."
"It helps to have such a talent for line delivery — you can make anything funny, such as when Ehrenreich’s Eddie is asked by his friend and Syd’s fixer, Daveed (Jackson Jr), if the penne pasta he’s eating is plain or has sauce on it."
"Save yourself the price of admission and just watch the trailer if you haven’t already, or—better yet—make your own TikTok version. It’ll be funnier and will cost viewers a lot less time."
"Why does the bear kill everyone it meets during its drug rampage except for the one person it decides to kidnap? Why don’t people with guns shoot the bear when they have the chance? Because the movie needs to happen, that’s why!"
"French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard allegedly said that all you needed for a good movie was “a girl and a gun.” If the movie is called “Cocaine Bear,” all you need is yayo and a clone of Yogi."
'Cocaine Bear' is bonkers fun for grownups.
“Cocaine Bear” could be a stoner’s guilty pleasure.
The film hits the sweet spot of being gruesome and funny simultaneously.
Not since Snakes on a Plane has a self-styled B-movie so thoroughly failed to deliver on the one-joke promise of its title as Cocaine Bear. 
"The problem I have with Cocaine Bear is that it's not cheesy enough... It's too gory and sentimental to be funny, and it's not gory enough to be scary. It lives in this weird genre place where it's jack of all trades but master of none. "
[It] acts like it’s above the clichés it’s stringing together.
"The film is well made, efficient, clever, and some of its funny lines will have you, um, snorting. But in the end, it’s still about a bear on a coke binge."
Shocking nobody -- this is not a family night out at the movies with the kiddiewinkles but by crikey it's a fun welcome distraction for the grown-ups.
"Gamely ignoring the old injunction that you should never work with children or animals, Keri Russell has a wild time in this deranged bad taste romp."
[Cocaine Bear's] screenplay is so barmy and confusingly plotted that no amount of star-factor could lift it above the level of “stoner curio”.
"Pretty good story, but Cocaine Bear takes it to new heights of ridiculousness."
Cocaine Bear is a success...by putting the emphasis on a handful of extremely gnarly kills and sprinkling in just enough weirdness to keep the entire train moving. 
"[Banks] seems remarkably free of illusions, either about herself or Hollywood — a good egg, in short — and Cocaine Bear has just enough of her qualities to get by."
"At its best, Cocaine Bear showcases a surprisingly savage wit – an ambulance chase being the film’s highlight, ripped straight out of the Final Destination 2 playbook, and given a Wet Hot American Summer overhaul."
"Banks and writer Jimmy Warden milk every inch of humor from the titular pitch, but the bear's manic drug-induced antics leave little for the human characters to do other than die in a bloody, if occasionally funny, manner. "
"Director Elizabeth Banks has a great time peppering the screen with throwaway gags that are genuinely hilarious, while weaving the strands of Jimmy Warden's screenplay into a riotously silly romp."
Incredibly funny and surprisingly gory. 
"Cocaine Bear might sound like it is going to be some frivolous D-grade schlock like Sharknado, but it is, believe it or not, well made with an A-film budget, an A-list cast and crew, and B-grade horror film sensibilities."
"A mixture of horror and comedy that's completely wild and over the top. Not for everyone, but if you change your state of mind it's nearly impossible to not have a good time. Very violent."
The film doesn't succeed at what it's attempting to be (as a schlocky horror-comedy). 
"Despite being inspired by true events, the concept is totally absurd. Yet, the film never manages to capture that particular tone. [Full review in Spanish]"
[It's] basically a mix of James Wan’s Malignant and the bear scene from The Revenant. 
"Great premise, strong start, bad, bad third act."
"It may not quite reach the ridiculous highs that you'd expect a film called 'Cocaine Bear' to reach, but it's still a fun enough time with a very game cast."
"Cocaine Bear is a ride from start to finish, using several plotlines to keep things moving and keep us watching a cocaine-fueled bear attack people."
"There are far too many characters and the crime subplot feels like a Pulp Fiction knock-off from the late 90s, but Banks balances the comedy, gore and action well. The characters are mostly lovable and the gore (and use of slow-mo) is A+."
"Cocaine Bear is mindless entertainment in its purest and most uncut form. It is so dumb, so over the top with gore, and so funny that you can’t help but root for this doped up bear’s murderous rampage to not only continue, but hopefully never end."
This movie simultaneously made me feel nothing and yearn for more.
"Cocaine Bear is the kind of movie that knows exactly what it is, does that well, and has no pretenses about being anything else."
'Cocaine Bear' is like if you bought a funny t-shirt and then found out you had to wear it every day for an entire year. Or like the meme equivalent of your dad catching you smoking and making you finish the pack. 
"Desperately in search of a coherent plot, Cocaine Bear strings a dozen of them together with the hope that something sticks, a gag will land, a brutal death will be effective, a moment will resonate. None of that happens. "
"But reframing the legend as a vengeful specter instead of Tony Todd’s romantic, Byronic icon inadvertently erases Anthony’s agency and individuality, and glosses over how Candyman terrorizes his community."
"The film keeps you on edge the entire way through with its different strains of Horror, Body, Psychological, & Slasher! The film might be too short & rushed but its journey was an impressive one"
"Nia DaCosta does a fabulous job at modernising Candyman; the gore, violent sequences, and general atmosphere are almost suffocating."
"At its core, Candyman (2021) attempts to explore how Black trauma is intergenerational.

Exploring how the atrocities inflicted on our ancestors years prior still affect our lives today."
"Candyman has style to spare in its horror setpieces, but the script is far too cluttered and confusing for its social commentary to land, despite director Nia DaCosta's best efforts behind the camera."
"It’s a great idea on the surface, but the story ends up needlessly convoluted and with gaping holes in its logic. And while it seems interested in meaningful topics such as race and gentrification, just referencing them isn’t the same as dealing with them"
"There is hardly a moment when the characters and themes are all that alluring, leaving dissatisfaction at the bungled storytelling that ends on a ridiculous note that is unfulfilling."
Nia DaCosta's artful horror sequel reflexively rewrites both the traditions of its own franchise and the white narratives of American history.
"The ending of the movie doesnt quite work, and comments on contemporary issues such as police violence, gentrification and systemic racism dont always fit with the established mythology of the series."
"CANDYMAN has a lot of exciting ideas on its mind and it continues the classic original pretty cleverly, but as an intense, gripping slasher film it just doesnt completely work for me."
"DaCosta builds upon the thoughtful original to investigate the politics of race, gentrification, and history in a manner better suited to the metaphoric potential of horror, resulting in a far more decisive, clarified, and emotionally involving tale.  "
What so easily could have been a bland sequel that is simply trying to make a quick buck on an established character is instead a motivated and inspired final product that is truly one of the best films of the year.
Candyman is a worthy sequel to the 1992 original. It's well-paced and it builds upon the universes mythology in a meaningful way.
Nia DaCosta's reboot/sequel retains the Chicago setting of its influential 1992 predecessor but relocates the shocks to a bougie-artsy 2021 milieu where talent and education ultimately provide no escape or defense from the racist past or present.
What's most satisfying about Candyman is just how smart it is without ever becoming smug.
"CANDYMAN is a breathtaking beauty of a horror film. Clever, brutal and entrancing, it spreads its dark wings over you as you watch the colors in front of you."
Viewers of the new Candyman movie get overblown discourse instead of genuine horror.
"It's ironic that, for a movie marinating in major issues, the most imagination is exhibited in the kill scenes."
"A tremendous and impressive piece of work, that manages to revive an old horror classic while also charting its own distinctive path through the material."
"Instead of projecting the monster onto an outside other, that gaze is directed inward and outward simultaneously... Fear of the monster is fear of one's own tail, one's own reflection."
"DaCosta's film draws from Chicago's history, specifically the real life Cabrini-Green housing project, to explore the terrors of the Urban Gothic through a Black perspective."
Nia DaCosta's schmick sequel is coolly self-aware and as charged as an electrical storm.
"A smart, thought-provoking and chilling horror piece with an important social commentary that mends the mistakes of the 1992 film. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Thoughtfully co-written and directed by Nia DaCosta, this new Candyman is scary, fun, and socially relevant at the same time. Very much of its time, this reignition of the franchise came along when it was needed most."
...succeeds as both a superior sequel and a better-than-average contemporary horror effort.
A labyrinth in paint-splattered coveralls.
Nia DaCosta's Candyman takes a totally brave but clever path by establishing the story as a sequel to the original film. [Full review in Spanish]
"The result is a mixed bag. Without the background, without Helen's investigation and her introduction to this world, this ""Candyman"" movie falls more in line with the meet-and-slash routine of other horror reboots."
"There's a lot to respect about the aesthetics of the film and how it expands the mythology of the original, but I found the film's handling of the social commentary to be too heavy handed."
"What it lacks in focus and subtlety, it makes up for with style, intensity and a strong climax that's a nightmare turned righteous."
"Coherence suffers because of an excess of characters, dialogue and plot convolutions, but DaCosta brings home a horror movie that feels scary, insightful and surprisingly laced with more than a trace of tragedy."
"While Candyman's centre may not be as tasty as it should be, it is nevertheless an entertaining watch filled with Easter eggs for devoted horror fans and it should propel both its cast and director onto Hollywood's A-list."
"After looking forward to it for so long, it's hard not to feel let down about the film's lack of imagination."
"The implacable, surprising ending elevates the bar just enough to make it passable."
"Candyman (2021) might not win awards, but it's worth the watch to keep Candyman's legacy alive."
A heavy-handed misfire...
"Ultimately, this one does get its bloody hook into you - and it may have you avoiding mirrors for a while."
"A powerful work of clear passion and palpable anger that's crafted with tense, needling thrills and exquisite vision."
"Though it tries to be too many things in one, the themes of injustice, racism, and being the agent of one's own story that rise to the surface are the ones that speak the loudest ..."
Candyman builds on the character elements and references from the original story to expand its horrifying lore and deliver performances to often entertaining effect.
The film's straightforward aesthetic also does away with much of the visceral horror that made the original so memorable.
You couldn't come up with a better recipe for creating a supernatural murderer if you went into the Occult Section of the Springfield Elementary library.
Director Nia DaCosta debuted in 2019 with the excellent Little Woods. She brings a similar sense of smart improvisation to the best scenes in Candyman.
Candyman is a movie worth watching.
The ideas are fascinating. But they lose resonance fast if they are trapped in a preachy mess of a thing.
"This movie is not only scary, it has a style and sheen to it."
"DaCosta has reclaimed the narrative started by Bernard Rose in the original 1992 film, crafting a sumptuous chiller with a lot on its mind."
"With its shadow puppetry, sophisticated reclamation of the Candyman legend and slick, confident filmmaking, even for those not thrilled by the idea of horror cinema more generally, it is hard to deny that Candyman is a massive and exciting step forward"
"The combined talent of the director and her screenwriters Jordan Peele and Wim Rosenfeld, manages to create an atmosphere of growing suspense. [Full review in Spanish]"
"To be completely effective horror movies can't waste any time, and while the Candyman mythos might feel repetitive, DaCosta's camerawork and eye for the unsettling create an entertaining new product."
A compelling story that explores how urban legends rise out of traumatic injustices; how those traumas continue to haunt communities over generations; and how the victims of those injustices can be turned into monsters by the stories we choose to tell.
"Does the new Candyman film succeed at bringing the franchise back to life? Yes, absolutely."
"It's in the ""Get Out"" level category of relevant horror."
A modestly satisfying horror film with a whole lot to say and nary a clue how to say it all.
"DaCosta proves her directing prowess with plenty of terrifying and provoking shots... [But] there is more to Black existence than pain, and it was a little disappointing that Candyman didn't reflect that."
"And that, in a nutshell, is what Candyman is - a legend that trades in the currency of pain and neglect to become an entity that won't be allowed to fade into the ether because it's just too profitable."
It's hard not to watch it and wonder what could have been.
"I liked that this movie kept you guessing and it was entertaining. However some of the performances were a bit uneven, particularly Yahya, but still a solid film."
I think some of the performances were a bit over the top and some of the dialogue had me raising my eyebrows. I will see this again because I think I missed a lot of easter eggs.
"This film really surprised me. The fact that Nia DaCosta captured a modern tone that fits perfectly in with the original ""Candyman"" is incredible. Solid performances and suspense throughout."
"Acute and skillfully made, ""Candyman"" is also pointedly political."
"Candyman hits the heights more often than not, and, in terms of modern horror sequels, it's right up there with the best of them."
"I love that coming out of this new Candyman, the iconic character becomes a symbol representing something that is so much more powerful than just a tortured soul who kills anyone who dares utter his name five times in a mirror."
...the story becomes its own as it uses the original boogeyman in new and scary ways.
"It's succulent, smart and clever."
DaCosta transforms the iconic horror film into a relevant modern-day sequel. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II gives us a stirring performance as an obsessed artist driven to the brink of madness much like Jeff Goldblum's Seth Brundle.
"DaCosta is holding up the mirror, and in the overpowering bleakness, there's just the faintest glimmer of hope. It's rather small. Actually about the size of a bee."
"This is great fun, with an underlying message. There's a lot packed into these 91 minutes."
"There's no sign of the razor sharp observations from the film that started it all, which meticulously incorporated not just racial but class and gender dynamics."
"Stay for the impeccably crafted genre scares, but don't expect the film to provide any clear commentary, as it valiantly tries to address many important issues, but ultimately falls short."
The way it reframes the original story to reflect on the horrors of the past and a relentless cycle of violence is compelling and provocative.
"In lacking an animating mystery, thematic question, or good enough style to justify their slaughter, Candyman's carcasses hit the ground without much resonance; each killing reads more like a job than a source of pleasure, righteous vengeance, or release."
Not every horror film offers a lot to unpack but Nia DaCosta's new Candyman has so many layers that it is almost too much to process in 90 minutes. And that's not a bad thing.
"Nia DaCosta's wickedly smart Candyman conjures the pain with a pulpy wit and stylish thrills, all while fueling a red-hot undercurrent of social-justice fury."
"There's enough material here for a couple of movies, though Candyman clocks 90 minutes sharp which is nice after so many bloated summer tentpoles."
"It's difficult to discuss the film without revealing the twist, but it's an expansion to the mythos that's downright beautiful."
"You can watch [Candyman] as a straightforward horror movie and get what you want. You can watch it as a thoughtful piece of societal commentary and get what you want. Or you can watch it as both, embracing both the medium and the message."
A provocative exploration of the ways in which historical trauma is processed and understood.
"Merging horror and politics, this eponymous sequel to the 1992 hit is enjoyably grisly and genuinely unsettling."
The directing and visuals were without a doubt the standouts. Candyman had a great deal of potential that's decreased by its runtime and lack of character development.
At its best when it hews closest to being a pure slasher.
Nia DaCosta's 'Candyman' urges the importance of Black voices to tell their stories as an urban legend manifests not to be forgotten.
They've taken the fun out of Candyman.
"Candyman is at its best as a story about stories-how they themselves are living things that evolve, the degree to which they are shaped by interpretation, how they can be manipulated"
It's magnificent.
"DaCosta pulls together a series of impressive set pieces, all built around Candyman's appearance in mirrors, and most especially a grisly bathroom mass murder that manages to be both grotesquely bloody and free of violence."
"It bogs itself down not only with an overload of its own mythos and recappings of the first film, but also in trying to tackle so many different subjects and social issues to the point that it's hard to discern what exactly it wants to say about them."
"This is a top-tier horror movie, its text and subtext in near-perfect balance, delivering plenty of shock and gore along with some genuinely challenging thematic material."
"Politically and visually gruesome, yet flawlessly designed and depicted, this slasher flick also revels in horror's ability to elevate matters of social unrest by transforming the urban legend into a shocker of a superhero."
"It felt as though it had much more bark than it did bite. On the other hand, I'm STILL not saying this man's name in any mirrors...ever."
Nia DaCosta's Candyman is one of the best new films I've seen this year. This is such a pristine and pertinent film that I feel frankly humbled to be writing about it.
DaCosta on the whole has delivered a confectionary delight of importance and a fitting way to carry this legend forward giving another intelligent voice to the oppressed while putting in respect for those that have come before.
"...reasonably slick and well made, Candyman's 2021 incarnation feels like marginal notes..."
"The Candyman as a villain leaves much to be desired ... Candyman is often frustrating in its ambiguities and inconsistencies, but it does get us to approach uncomfortable topics that would have otherwise been left on the table."
"Candyman expands on its predecessor and produces a nicely made film, but doesn't quite push the horror aspect or elevate the message enough."
"The tension of a serial killer on the loose, particularly of the supernatural variety, is juxtaposed with the tension people of color feel while negotiating a white world."
"The ideas are there-the continuity of violence, art and commercialism and exploitation, gentrification and haunting-but it doesn't go anywhere."
"Artful in every sense of the word, playing with imagery that might have come straight from Clive Barker."
"Beautifully directed by Nia DaCosta with an equally beautiful, pulse-pounding score, Candyman sets the standard for post-modern horror."
"The visuals, social commentary and excellent performances overcome some of the movie's more scattered elements."
"I did occasionally find it just a bit too pat and too contrived to melt my more critical lens entirely, but it won me over with its nicely handled comedic touches, lovely performances, and both its clear-eyed positivity and its shamelessly huge heart."
"If not for Tom Hanks, ""A Man Called Otto"" might be a boring tale of one grumpy man's perseverance against the elements trying to take him down. But it's because of Hanks that the film succeeds. "
The drama movie is touching but never truly remarkable.
"Despite having a somewhat interesting start with the presence of Hanks as the unfriendly neighbor, it is a remake that loses the desired dramatic effect by sometimes going down the route of calculated poignancy. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Tom Hanks was an absolute blast to watch on screen, and his interaction with his co-stars were some of my favorite scenes in the movie. He commanded the screen with his betrayal of Otto. "
"It proves again, the everyman of the movies, can play any mood or soul. The movie is patient, and a special shoutout to Mariana Trevino for taking a slightly underwritten role and giving it depth. "
"Subtle, sincerely redemptive comedic drama...Tom Hanks delivers a carefully modulated, understated performance, as does his 'real-life' son Truman, but the script tends to be overly melodramatic."
"The director is Marc Forster of Monster's Ball. For sure, his saccharine movie is not hard to like, if only because he is a pro at manipulating heartstrings and Hanks cannot help but be affable, however ill-suited for his role here."
 Tom Hanks gets in touch with his inner Larry David as the curmudgeonly sexegenarian at the heart of Marc Forster’s lukewarm English-language remake of Hannes Holm’s Oscar-nominated “A Man Called Ova.” 
"With Hanks as its star, Marc Forster’s safe Hollywood remake is all the more predictable."
A Man Called Otto is mechanically engineered for maximum lachrymosal extraction. 
"Tom Hanks is trying to channel his inner Clint Eastwood for this US adaptation of Fredrik Bachman’s Swedish best-seller - the problem is, he simply isn’t grouchy enough"
A film that gets by thanks to Hanks' unwavering watchability though there's not a beat or a revelation we haven't seen before and  taking its biggest emotional cue directly from She's Having a Baby is an annoyingly misguided choice.
"This slice of superior schmaltz has Tom Hanks as a fastidious late-middle-aged grump who hates everyone, from overcharging shop assistants to neighbours who put their recycling in the wrong bin. "
"Tom Hanks does his best to look mean, but his inherent affability never fails to shine through. Otto discovers to his disgust that there is no avoiding mushiness."
"With a terrific supporting cast – Mariana Trevino is the MVP of this journey, and she’s a force of nature as the kind neighbor Marisol. Without her as a counterpart, this would be a difficult, one-note story."
"It’s the kind of schmaltzy, big performance studio drama that used to get a billion Oscar nominations, and darn it, I kind of miss those being in vogue."
A sweet story of the power of community to bring someone back from the brink of suicide. A film like this depends on the performances - and here there are some weak links and some standout performances.  
A predictable tear-jerker made no less enjoyable or heartfelt by its predictability.
"Hanks plays the feel-good card, mixed with comic moments, sentimentality, and a cute cat. Cat or not, [it] emphasizes that living improves by interacting warmly with others. "
"When a feature needs a good-natured supporting character to make its audience care about its hostile protagonist, that isn't a great sign."
"Despite its slow start, Otto mostly hits its emotional mark"
"Mawkish and tonally messy, A Man Called Otto squanders a pertinent story about loneliness in favour of old geezer antics. Not even the universally beloved Hanks can save a film that mishandles its sentiment so badly."
"Marc Forster and screenwriter David Magee previously worked together on Finding Neverland, so they know just how to frame tragic circumstances with a lighter touch, while not skimping on the emotional gut punch"
"“A Man Called Otto” lays down a familiar pattern for its storytelling and action. The movie clicks because Tom Hanks delivers a performance that is always in the moment. You sense there’s a more pleasant past Otto could recapture, if he’s willing."
"With cowardly mildness, this white-bread mush misuses its star’s likability. Tom Hanks trying to be grumpy yet endearing has the opposite impact. He’s somehow less endearing than he’s been before."
"Touches on the same weighty themes as 'Ove' — isolation, suicide, and mortality among them — but from the start, director Marc Forster...pulls back the drapes to brighten what in the original version was a decidedly murky room."
A surprisingly cranky Tom Hanks can't elevate this cringe-worthy drama.
"Tom Hanks is reliably, dependably Tom Hanksy in this feelgood comedy-drama, the newest addition to the “grumpy old guy in need of redemption” genre. Unfortunately, his steady work is almost undone by clunky direction and shoddy, shortcut scripting."
"A follow-the-dots flick with a few moments of charm that aims to be a feel-good crowd pleaser, but lacks enough freshness and insight to make it anything special."
"Despite the film’s flaws, what audiences will take away is a humanizing experience by a group of misfits who are learning that getting along can also be lifesaving."
"If you were to start [this remake and the original] at the exact same moment, I promise it wouldn't make any difference which one you looked at. But you know why? Because all the scenes were working in the first movie, too. "
"Hanks is perfect for this. He's playing the grumpiest of grumpy old men, and because it's Tom Hanks, it has extra power. "
I'm just not sure we needed it... [but] I did like it a whole lot more than I thought I was going to.
"Just because the movie isn’t as bad as it could be doesn’t make it good, but it also won’t make it any less appealing at the numerous family viewings that A man Called Otto will no doubt become a staple of."
"Even the most skeptical of moviegoers will be moved by A Man Called Otto’s undeniable warmth and timely message about looking past one’s surface to see the person inside. You just might reach for the Kleenex, then get angry at yourself for doing so. "
"It’s a perfectly fine film, made better by a great cast and Hanks’ presence as a natural movie leader, and sometimes that’s enough."
"You know exactly where it’s going and the journey there isn’t spectacularly original, but at least the payoff is sweet and tender. "
It contains enough truth to make the movie a hit among grownups looking back on their own lives with a mixture of happy nostalgia and wistful regret.
...a deliberately-paced yet progressively compelling drama...
It's pleasant enough. 
Wonderful performances by Tom Hanks and Mariana Treviño keep the film from succumbing into saccharine territory. [Full review in Spanish]
"It ends on a heartwarming note, one that the film for the most part earns, even though Hanks isn't right for this part. "
"Two actors can have great chemistry that has nothing to do with romance, as in Tom Hanks and Mariana Treviño.  They are great together and make this English-language remake worth watching.  "
"I haven’t read the 2012 Swedish book or 2015 film that this is based on, but I can’t imagine either could be half as tone-deaf."
Hanks offscreen persona gets too much in the way of the film. It relies on the emotional baggage associated with the plot vs earning the opportunity to tug at our heartstrings. Treviño brings the only improvement to this adaptation of an adaptation. 
"It’s inherently tricky making a feel-good movie with so many traumatic moments, but “A Man Called Otto” is a decent enough American remake of the Swedish original."
"Hanks works well outside his comfort zone as a grump, and this story will win your heart over some obvious corniness."
I didn’t care about the plot. I wanted to spend as much time as I could with these characters. I wanted to hang out.
"While it is a pleasure to see Hanks and Trevino bring their voices to the material, A Man Called Otto plays like a good cover band replicating a hit. "
"... the issues with the film don't stem from cynicism or an insensitive standpoint, but from the manipulative and overt resources with which the artists built this well-intentioned fable. [Full review in Spanish]"
Definitely gives off enough warm and fuzzy vibes to pull on the heartstrings and make us care about the characters.
Foster and Hanks make this increasingly sentimental film go down easy.
"As always, Tom Hanks is in there pitching. But the cliched plot about a reformed grumpy old man is so obvious you can see it from outer space."
"Let’s face it, anything Tom Hanks is in becomes elevated to the next level by his mere presence."
"Tom Hanks is our most reliable everyman star, the sort of guy who can do both gruff, put-upon loner and gruff, helpful neighbor with equal skill. It’s funny when he attacks a hospital clown because he’s actualizing so many of our secret urges. "
"Columbia Pictures has marketed A Man Called Otto as a heartwarming comedy, but don’t be fooled. The movie has some heartwarming and comedic scenes, but it’s a very sad—and flawed—film."
"Forster’s latest has an incredibly wholesome interior despite depicting explicitly morbid and sensitive themes, but the film still feels like it captures the essence of an ill-tempered, lovable old man.
"
"The best hand this film plays is the chemistry between Hanks and Treviño, a bond filled with warmth and humanity that elevates the predictable screenplay... [Full review in Spanish]"
It’s too busy aiming for the heart when it should be going for the jugular.
"At times, the story about a man who through his peers discovers how to fill the void that a loss produces, has the scent of the films that the mythical Frank Capra shot in the forties. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Much better than its Spanish title suggests (what did it cost them to call it “A Man Called Otto” instead of ""A grumpy neighbour""?), but predictable and slightly inferior to the films that Hanks usually releases in theatres. Full review in Spanish."
"There is a welcome air of optimistic universality about this adaptation that remains the driving force behind both films. A Man Called Otto may not be perfect, but its message is sure to resonate with a great number of people. "
A Man Called Otto is a moving story of living through and after grief and the people that are there to help you. 
"No, “Otto” contains no surprises and I’m fine with that. Films like “Otto” are necessary, and I would argue vital, to combat the constant barrage of overwhelming negativity that buffets us."
"A Man Called Otto is a tearjerking story of redemption that tries a bit too hard to strum the heartstrings, but, thanks to the performances, still manages to find resonate, emotional moments."
"For a film focused on the size of one man’s heart, A Man Called Otto lacks what its protagonist has in spades. It feels produced from a factory with its half-complete characters and surging score designed to tell people precisely when to feel something. "
A heartwarming tale about finding life after loss and finding the good in others.
" a heartwarming, if somewhat simplistic, look at aging, loneliness, and grief, as well as the healing power of community and relationships."
"Not exactly heartwarming, it has a bitter edge, forgoes easy sentiment, and lifts us in deep midwinter. Like Otto, a little effort and openness can make things better. "
Cranky Tom Hanks is as watchable as many other big-screen incarnations of Tom Hanks.
"We know where this film is going from the first scene, but it’s easy to settle in with Hanks’ instantly entertaining characterization as he skillfully sands down Otto’s rough edges with subtle humor."
"Tom Hanks and Mariana Treviño both give amazing performances in this film in demanding roles. It is not easy to make these characters work in this story, but they manage to do it."
A Man Called Otto is perfect for anyone who wants a feel-good story and a reminder to check in with your network and neighbors. You never know what someone might be going through. 
"Despite building its cinematic offer on simple and predictable dramatic ground, A Man Called Otto delivers a genuine emotional experience. [Full review in Spanish]"
Perhaps the most relevant point of the film is Otto's awareness of the world that used to be but is no longer... [Full review in Spanish]
"Much like the pretty lame Force Majeure remake, Downhill, it’s as if studios are being told to “dumb it down,” as all the edges have been sanded off in favor of very obvious, sitcom-y bits to make up the difference. "
"Not ground-breaking but sturdy, tender, and ably supported by Tom Hanks’ reliably strong, unfussy performance."
"Tom Hanks scowls and shines in his first legit ""old man"" role in this remake of the 2015 Swedish film that doesn't really have a reason to exist, but still brings the pathos."
"An odd yet oddly irresistible display, A Man Called Otto is as predictable as they come, but hey, it passes the time nicely."
Another great reminder of Hanks's everlasting quality.
"The movie, directed by Marc Forster, merely checks off a list of heartwarming virtues while turning its characters into ciphers."
A Man Called Otto is more out of touch than old fashioned with a helpful heaping of hokum Hanks.
"For the most part, A Man Called Otto works despite itself."
" I appreciate any time I get to see Hanks on the big screen, but I hope he finds less annoying ways to stretch his acting legs moving forward."
"Coming to us in the dead of winter, I can see why some may, despite their best intentions, fall for it. Because, for better or worse, this one feels like a big warm blanket. "
"i can't really buy Tom Hanks as a cranky old man, he's so typecast at this stage of his career"
A Man Called Otto is a benign comedy-drama that peppers a heart-wrenching story with plenty of eye-rolling jokes to distract you from its perfectly pedestrian plot.
The best films are the ones that make audiences think without explicitly telling them to do so. A Man Called Otto puts a magnifying glass on one man's quaint life experience and shows the good that can and will happen when people love thy neighbor.
"... The movie gets increasingly saccharine, like being forced to drink a mug of tea with a new lump of sugar added every time you take a gulp."
"Formulaic movies are the bread and butter of moviegoing (audiences feel a sense of comfort when given exactly what they expect) but everyone involved, including Hanks, deserved better than what “A Man Called Otto” delivers. "
"A passable, if forgettable movie, that stings like a disappointment only because I know how effective the original film is."
If you do go out to see this new version I bet you'll have a good time and leave feeling uplifted.
We know before we’ve even sat down in the theater who’s going to end up taking care of that cat.
All but the most dogged of sceptics will be charmed by the message of the redemptive power of small acts of kindness and plastic containers full of tamales.
The material is massively beneath its star.
"It’s not Tom Hanks’ masterpiece, but just a fine outing for the man who can do roles like this in his sleep."
"For the most part, the picture ticks along at a calm Scandinavian pace, but, every now and then, Forster gives in to his more bombastic instincts. "
"A Man Called Otto is a triumph of emotional manipulation in the kindest way I can mean it. It’s built on a fantasy that tends to disinterest me as a concept, yet, because of the downright loveliness of everyone involved...worked on me like a charm. "
"This English-language remake of the 2015 Swedish Oscar nominee “A Man Called Ove” pales in comparison, but an amiable cast helps make it entertaining. "
"Wind River is a well crafted, but straightforward, thriller with an interesting setting and social context. "
Sheridan’s direction matches his screenwriting – steady and assured. His knack for pacing keeps the story bumping along all while building tension and fleshing out his characters.
"Through every snowflake and gunshot, Taylor Sheridan cuts to the marrow and keeps ""Wind River"" firmly on track with its layered stages of discovery."
"Wind River has the tonal sparsity of a Cormac McCarthy novel, the moral justice of a revisionist Western, and hits many beats that a detective procedural might. "
"What can pass as a standard murder-mystery instead becomes a remarkably complex exploration of various malaises, including the agony of familial loss, the systematic disenfranchisement of Native Americans, and the ever-present evil of toxic masculinity."
"Wind River almost defies genre definition. It's ultimately a murder mystery thriller but it's also a drama about family, loss, suffering, respect, and compassion."
This is a debut to be proud of.
"'Wind River' paints a bleak picture, at times not bleak enough."
"Destruction and revenge are still satisfying, separately, but they don't fit with the slow-burn murder/mystery that kicked things off."
"After penning ""Hell or High Water,"" Taylor Sheridan makes his directorial debut, blending murder mystery, western ruggedness, comedic interludes and crime meditations in a unique setting."
"Exceptional genre filmmaking, and yet another example of Sheridan's searing talent."
Why can't a movie be made imbued with relentless opposition to the existing social order?
"Like the land in which it takes place, Wind River is a harsh and relentless film. It's an intense slow burn that leads to a climax that gives up its revelation in a quick and explosive burst."
"As a writer, Taylor Sheridan has already proven himself. As a director, I consider this somewhat of a practice round."
"A taut, cold mystery, and a strong directorial offering, especially for a filmmaker with only one other feature under his belt."
"The film features a tense, atmospheric mystery, sustained by the protagonist, who acts like the cowboy in a modern western. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It's an exercise in great storytelling, character development, superior acting, and establishing a sense of location that brings us unsettlingly close to facing our own prejudices."
podcast review
"The acting is strong, the characters complex and the story realistic."
"More predictable than it is a disappointment, Wind River may not be incredibly nuanced, but is more often than not enjoyable."
"Wind River is as much of a gritty crime thriller as it is a character study. While the former sometimes suffers in service of the latter, the film is, in the end, greater than the sum of its parts."
"There is a reason Wind River is gaining momentum. While it can be hard to watch at times, it is a compelling story that envelopes the audience from the opening scenes."
This feels like a train at full speed. A thriller set in a cold and unforgiving place with no rules. [Full review in Spanish].
"Inspired by true events, Wind River isn't a film about one story, it's about something bigger: The injustice faced by murdered and missing Indigenous women."
"While it never quite matches its own ambitions, Sheridan still manages to deliver a crackerjack mystery that relies on characters rather than twists, turns, or shocks."
A great portrait of human grief.
"I love that Taylor Sheridan is just as concerned with his characters as he is with solving a murder case, putting this film far and above a typical CSI or Law & Order's 'whodunnit' episode."
I had a few issues with the way the female characters were portrayed but it was still an engaging mystery.
"Jeremy Renner proves as safe a pair of hands as ever, grounding the emotion and making this into much more than the formulaic revenge pic it could've become."
"Wind River is undeniably a success. It's an emotionally powerful film that features some good performances. However, it does seem to have suffered a little from [Taylor] Sheridan's taking of the auteur reins."
A tense and slow-burn murder mystery with one giant sucker-punch of an ending.
"When the tone flips on its head later in the film, Wind River becomes something else entirely: a vivid, gripping peek into life on the fringes."
WIND RIVER proves now that Taylor Sheridan is one of the great contemporary American storytellers.
"If I were to give it a name, it'd be a neo-western-noir mystery thriller. Cinema would be a better place if there was more of them."
"This is a bleak tale that unfolds in compelling fashion, anchored by outstanding work from Jeremy Renner."
"That rare crime thriller that's about solving a crime but not necessarily working out some elaborate ""mystery."""
"It's a really enjoyable thriller, whose worthy politics show that it's a labour of love for its creator."
Sheridan's work cinematically addresses one of the coldest crimes to have ever been committed (and is still happening) on this star-spangled soil.
"The wintry setting manages to chill you right to the bone, and the injustices within the story make you bemoan the state of mankind."
A thought provoking murder/mystery that shines a light on reservation laws while being a solid directorial debut from Sheridan.
"The character development was dope. You felt the place, you felt the characters -- this is Jeremy Renner's best performance since... The Town."
"The heroes, in the film's denouement, focus on what has been lost, and the story spends as much time memorializing the victims as it does tracking the villains. It is a thoughtful and tragic film."
"Standout performances and excellence in direction, writing and cinematography create one of the best films of 2017."
"Wind River reveals itself to be a full-fledged message movie. This shift in tone, while not surprising considering the cartoonish villains and muted sentiment, goes against the film's natural instincts."
"Unfortunately, [Sheridan] just didn't do a great job of making it about the missing and murdered indigenous people so much as he instead made it about another boring white guy."
"Wind River ultimately aims to be an existential survival movie, but that aim is rarely true."
Sheridan leaves little doubt about the psychological depth he aims to join to criminality. Renner's low key competence and authority supports that and says much about his growing suitability for this kind of role .
"Bleak stuff, but riveting."
"Wind River is done in a very realistic way. The's nothing extraordinary or fantastic about it, it's just people trying to do right by people."
"For those who enjoy some emotional chill amid the overheated blockbusters of summer, Wind River will fit the bill."
"Like his former screenplays, Sheridan punctuates his latest endeavour with instances of shocking violence that truly resonate and - one rather ludicrous Mexican standoff aside - they are breathtakingly ferocious."
The movie's strength is Sheridan's knack for vivid characterization through little more than casual remarks and consistent voices. Renner isn't an actor of great range but that works here by trusting the words.
"In his directorial debut Taylor Sheridan (screenwriter of Hell or High Water and Sicario), keeps the plot humming and offers some genuinely thrilling moments; even occasionally offering poignant insights on grief and loss."
Who knew Wyoming was a such a dangerous state?
"A ponderous policier that posits white saviors of native peoples for the umpteenth time. Except for the landscape photography, utterly forgettable."
"... both a lean, stripped down crime thriller and a muscular backwoods adventure, linear and fairly straightforward and, oddly, perhaps a little too talky when it comes to motivations and revelations."
"The disenfranchised and the victims, even in this modest, watchable mystery-thriller, deserve to be the heroes of their own stories."
... viscerally exposes a current problem. [Full review in Spanish]
"But premise aside, everything else about this movie feels fresh and powerfully authentic."
"The plot is straightforward but tense, and the characters well-drawn and excellently fleshed out by Renner and Olsen."
"It is intense, It is amazing. I loved the story. I loved every moment of the film. Taylor Sheridan is 3 for 3."
There is excellent camera and lighting work... [Full review in Spanish]
...a thrilling ride...
"A finely sketched character-driven murder mystery, Wind River is a beautifully penned piece of work from Taylor Sheridan, who makes his directing debut."
"Although it collapses in the third act, what comes before it is gripping and complex. [Full review in Portuguese.]"
One of the best films of 2017.
"An ambitious film, a little sloppy, but invigorating, well-made, well-acted, gorgeously photographed. It's poetic in its visuals and, as is tradition with Westerns, its justice."
"Where does Wind River end, and real life begin? This could well be the most important American film of 2017."
"... the story's small failings never completely finding a way to override the film's intentions, or more importantly, message."
Sheridan succeeds in delivering both an expose on the struggles of contemporary reservation life and a tautly executed procedural set against an epic backdrop of hostile beauty.
...the film benefits substantially from an inclusion of impressively engrossing sequences...
For what it is-a procedural thriller-Wind River is above average.
This film is certainly one of the best of the year. [Full review in Spanish]
"An expert in police intrigue, [director Taylor] Sheridan has the rare ability to explore novel territories... [Full review in Spanish]"
"Wind River is equal parts beautiful and horrifying, hopeful and heartbreaking."
So it's refreshing to see him (Renner) starring in that rare thing -- a grown-up film arty enough to win a prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival and yet commercial enough -- I hope -- to do some fairly serious business at the box office.
"Propelled by smart and authentic dialogue, strong characterizations and the occasional burst of brutal violence, [Wind River] is a testament to Sheridan's abilities as a storyteller."
Sheridan's ear for fatalistic dialogue is bang on.
"Wind River is a compelling watch, with a strong sense of place, convincing performances and a welcome, if subtle, undercurrent o f political awareness."
"Sheridan ends his story brilliantly, the last ten minutes a startling display of emotional elasticity that left me flabbergasted."
Most of the dialogue would look good on a series of commemorative tea towels. It certainly doesn't belong on the lips of an actor as gifted as Renner.
Wind River is one of the best films of 2017.
Wind River's strong sense of place differentiates the film from the rest of the noir genre.
"The resonance of [Jeremy] Renner's understated acting, moments of unexpected visual splendor, and mounting psychological intensity make it all irresistibly compelling."
"Taylor Sheridan's flair for creating heartland epics is undimmed, but it's hard not to wonder what someone with more directing chops, and the will to hit the accelerator, would have done with it."
"The film offers lots more than twists and red herrings. The dialogue is beautifully underwritten, the soundtrack is moody, cinematography stunning and the casting is faultless."
"Renner is on good form here (and rocking a hard-to-pull-off pair of dungarees) as the sensitive, protective Cory, and as a genre exercise, it works."
Renner's performance - along with a mesmerising soundtrack by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis - is enough to carry it happily along.
Wind River ticks all the right boxes. It also leaves a bad smell.
"The various implausibilities in this film do not diminish its tremendous watchability, and in particular the lead performance of Renner."
"A tense, well-acted thriller that keeps you involved until the bitter end."
A curious but ultimately humane story of brutality and grief on a vast Native American reserve in Wyoming.
"There's ... an admirable air of confidence in the way Sheridan has structured the film, balancing its violent extremes with quieter emotional moments in which the broader social injustice the film is exploring can't help but bubble up through the cracks."
"I won't bore on here, even though it's my inclination, but will say that while Sheridan's intentions were undoubtedly noble, this makes the whole enterprise feel cheaply mainstream and exploitative."
"Taking its inspiration from several grim statistics, the film functions as both a first rate thriller and the type of movie that highlights an American social injustice while posing serious questions for anyone willing to listen."
It's an American thriller that will certainly appeal to fans of Scandinavian noir.
Wind River is a smart and very satisfying movie.
"In its marriage of man and landscape, Sheridan's film is like an Anthony Mann Western remade. It's a Naked Spur gone snowy; a Far Country gone far, feral and scenically tremendous."
"Wind River's examination of race, gender and grief are just as compelling as any stand-off."
A terrible shame to use such an interesting setting for such a conventional story.
Taut and effective. 
"Branagh’s confidence in direction is strong as ever with a narrative half-predicated on thoughtful sound design that equally hinges on his performance, the use of depth in frame draws the eye to clues and behavior while setting the mood"
"As a review, this film feels like a detective film from days past, younger audiences might want more, but those who enjoy a slow reveal will have a good time. It gets a B grade from me."
It’s not the same kind of reliable guilty pleasure we expect these vehicles to be [...] but this outing of Branagh’s Poirot is at least an interesting experiment in expanding these stories' usual limits.
"Stunningly cinematically accomplished that it is, this whirlwind spectacle comes out short in the one thing that matters most in a mystery – the story itself. [...] Feels like a hollowed-out pumpkin, minus the candlelight."
"Branagh’s third outing as Poirot is the charm... playing in the what-if gray area opens up options for some great visuals, startling reactions, and cranking up the spooky factor. "
"In Branagh’s relatively prolific corner of the playground, the real mystery continues to be how Poirot maintains that motherf—er on his face."
The secret ingredient has been none other than adapting Agatha Christie through the lens of gothic horror; a subtle twist that instantly turns the fantastic 'Mystery in Venice' into the most stimulating and enjoyable installment of the trilogy.
Hercule Poirot is back in this mildly entertaining whodunit with supernatural touches. [Full Review in Spanish]
"The film resonates with qualities found in classics of the genre by Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles, and is simultaneously reminiscent in its aggressive theatrical approach to Branagh’s own neo-noir thriller “Dead Again” from 1991."
A Haunting in Venice elevates well-worn genre tropes with exceptional casting and filmmaking flair to create a satisfying experience.
"A Haunting in Venice isn't quite the best of Kenneth Branagh's Hercule Poirot films, but it's still an inspired effort."
"After too many coincidences, Poirot is required to name the killer. Alas, his panache has undergone some wear and tear. Is here anything worse than a gloomy Hercule? He's still a man who needs to think rationally. Solving mysteries is his Belgian waffle."
Director and star Kenneth Branagh’s third outing as Agatha Christie’s brilliant and persnickety detective is his most satisfying turn yet. ... briskly entertaining Agatha Christie comfort food with a larger theme about the secrets we carry. 
"Thankfully, the consistently engaging Haunting feels fresh in a way the nonetheless enjoyable Death didn’t thanks to the addition of a spooky vibe to the series."
"The weakest of Branaugh's associations with Agatha Christie, highlighted by the miscasting of Tina Fey."
"The mystery itself is rushed and convoluted, rendering this a middling rather than truly timeless Christie adaptation."
"A Haunting in Venice is an adequate mystery, with shadows, mystique and a plot with twists and turns."
"The film presents a different Poirot than we’ve encountered, just like the story itself is more unfamiliar than the rest. A Haunting in Venice is an example of the treasure trove of stories that Christie has created that we have yet to explore on film."
"It's beautifully shot, perfectly set, and filled with great actors - and it's even mercifully under 2 hours. So if you want a good pre-Halloween snack with some chills and thrills but isn't too much, this is a fun one for you."
"It’s just some real solid meat and potatoes filmmaking that I’m starting to miss in a lot of stuff I see in the theater. I liked this film a lot, and I do hope they continue to make more of these, but who knows with the way show business is going."
"There is a specter of trauma that hangs over the whole movie, turning it from a good classic detective story into something more ghostly and spiritual. "
"[Kenneth Branagh] seems way more interested in doing gothic horror than mystery. The mystery, in fact, does not make all that much sense. "
Branagh and Fey make an appealing buddy couple: American sass meets European weltschmerz.
Those apparitions haunting A Haunting in Venice are the ghosts of better murder mysteries.
"A step up from Death on the Nile, but it would be nice to see Branagh color outside the lines of genre and convention every once in a while."
"Branagh tries so hard with those scares — doors banging, chandeliers plummeting, parrots screeching, ghosts looming — that they swiftly become about as chilling as your average caffe latte."
"Christie purists may bristle, but the additions work well, especially with Fey’s take on a sort-of sidekick writer full of humorous asides. "
My guess is that Kenneth Branagh had a lot more fun making A Haunting in Venice than we have watching it.
"When all the characters in a murder mystery are annoying, one loses interest in finding out who the killer really is. This movie scared me a little and annoyed me a lot."
"It's such a bold stylistic departure from its predecessors, its grandiose production design far more tangible than the garish CGI of Death on the Nile, that it feels somehow bracing and teeming with a nervous energy that's hard to shake. "
"The style, lucid from beginning to end, supports the ambiguity that inhabits the film. [Full review in Spanish] "
"Branagh's take on the material improves with each successive Poirot film. The A-list cast is great, although only Fey and Yeoh get opportunities to shine. It's Branagh's direction that takes center stage, helping to create actual scares and tension. "
"Though I love the cast and always enjoy the character of Hercule Poirot, A Haunting in Venice felt slow and uninteresting. "
"A Haunting in Venice is atmospheric enough – and entertaining enough – to make for an appealing Halloween-season diversion, but one walks away from it wishing it provided more. "
"Kenneth Branagh is not my ideal Hercule Poirot, but this film features an engaging cast and there's something delightful in this casual diversity casting. Also, loved the 1947 era costumes. "
"Kenneth Branagh’s possibly final entry has an elegance, a grace in how it balances the thematic darkness with the fun of a cracking good murder mystery. "
The third installment is clearly superior to its predecessor.  [Full review in Spanish]
"Branagh himself appears to be having a bit more fun this time, but Tina Fey is trying to outplay him and beyond that destraction there is still a Shakespearean-like hold he still has on this material making any possible sense of fun with it reductive. "
"A Haunting in Venice is easily the best of Branagh’s Christie adaptations, drawing deeply from the old-world atmosphere of Venice and the allure of a locked room mystery."
"A Haunting in Venice is a curiosity, on one hand, there are positives to take away but it also snatches some of them back, giving way to a clunky, disorderly pace that slows the initial promise and makes you feel criminally short-changed."
"Branagh’s strong performance is enough to make A Haunting in Venice worth your time, but fortunately this mystery has a little more up its sleeve to make it a worthy addition to a franchise that continues to deliver."
"A Haunting in Venice lacks the atmosphere and visual flair to properly spook viewers, or the character development to make the ensemble worth investing in."
"An Agatha Christie murder mystery has once again been made a mess by director Kenneth Branagh, this time with A Haunting in Venice."
A Haunting in Venice officially derails Kenneth Branagh’s rebooted Agatha Christie films.
"The cinematography, the background score and production design prove ample distraction from Poirot’s guesswork-based casework. Given how weak the source material is, and how disinterested Branagh is in the actual death itself, it’s for the best."
"More of a psychological thriller-ghost story than a horror tale, “A Haunting in Venice” is a satisfying movie for grown-ups – with a few well-placed jump scares to keep the mystery on track."
This is my favorite of the three.
It's fun. I think it's it's chilling. I think it's very effective emotionally.
A Haunting in Venice eventually progresses into a repetitive and momentum-free midsection...
This whodunit will haunt you.
That sounds thrilling – the kind of stuff that crackles on screen – but it isn’t. “A Haunting in Venice” flops largely because there’s too much talk and too little action.
"Smooth, sinister and studded with stars, A Haunting in Venice is precisely the kind of feet-up matinee entertainment that has rounded off generations of Sunday roasts, just as its David Suchet and Peter Ustinov predecessors did."
A Haunting in Venice sits somewhere between the Orient and the Nile and should keep the Christie fans in excellent spirits.
Kenneth Branagh finally lives up to his moustaches in the third and best of his Agatha Christie adaptations...
"The horror-lite element gives it a boost, with Branagh’s direction conjuring up a few jumps, but this gently entertaining mystery could have used far more scares."
"This film infuses the genre tropes of Murder on the Orient Express and its predecessor with the horror genre to mixed results. Each movie has been varying levels of mediocre. However, this one is a disappointment."
"While Branagh, Fey and Yeoh are enjoyable to watch, this is the least impressive of Branagh’s Poirot films, especially when it comes to the inevitable denouement."
A tribute to the Gothic cinema of yesteryear and also a work with deep themes that feel current. Hercule Poirot keeps him relevant thanks to this stylish and innovative horror film. [Full review in Spanish] 
A well made throwback to a time when whodunnits could also make the hairs on the back of our necks stand up. 
... Fun and exciting. Is it as good as the first two? Not quite. [Full review in Spanish]
"After the artificial misstep of Death on the Nile, Branagh makes sure the plot is water-tight, and everything is more grounded this time."
"A Haunting in Venice is short on any real spooks, but remains a satisfying and stylish murder mystery."
"It's such a dull, stiffly rendered mystery that neither the who nor the what of the crime (a mare-dare!, as intoned by Poirot) registers, and even the Venice setting, potentially its chief asset, is wasted..."
"A Haunting in Venice knows exactly what it’s doing. More Christie, played by A-listers having fun in a cosy-as-a-cushion, teatime ITV-drama-on-the-big-screen way — catering for a cinema audience left behind by superheroes."
"Other than Tina Fey adding a sporadic-dramatic pep to the proceedings, there is absolutely nothing worth your time in this cinematic barbiturate. "
It's not so much that we figure things out early on; it's that we're not given enough reason to immerse in the gloomy game Poirot must play.
"It may be the most simple mystery of the Poirot trilogy, but it is an authentic exercise in classic horror thanks to its camera angles and use of fish-eye lenses... [Full review in Spanish]"
All of the ingredients are in place. It’s just that the recipe is completely wrong.
"It’s not quite grisly enough to be a crime thriller, or juicy enough as a plot to sustain interest even as a mystery. The scares aren’t that scary, and Poirot’s solutions aren’t impressively revelatory. It’s Poirot by numbers."
"With such a great cast, location and setting Branagh’s inscrutable Poirot is not nearly as evocative nor tongue-in-cheek entertaining. By the time the case wraps up, we found it more undaunting than haunting."
"A Haunting in Venice is, by some margin, the best adaptation of the now trilogy featuring Hercule Poirot, correcting many past mistakes, and using Kenneth Branagh's innate talent as both filmmaker and actor to stand out as a darker, more atmospheric film."
"A Haunting in Venice is being sold as a scary movie yet it’s another good puzzle from Branagh, who goes for a slow burner approach that makes for an elegant mystery. The ghosts dissolve but the fun of the sleuthing remains."
A Haunting in Venice is well-made and broadly fits the mandate of what it’s supposed to be. It’s just not as much fun as its predecessors.
Branagh gives Poirot vulnerability and depth while handing us a visual feast in his latest Agatha Christie murder mystery
A Haunting in Venice is both the best Kenneth Branagh film and the best Agatha Christie adaptation in decades. 
It's not the most entertaining murder mystery I've seen but it had an interesting premise and engaged me throughout. 
"This was a pretty significant departure from its source material, which should have made it more intriguing and mysterious...it didn't. This is my favorite of the Branagh's adaptations, but that isn't saying much."
The twist(s) were pretty obvious to me from the first act. I wish the pacing was more consistent. 
"It's a well done, well-crafted story that has a lot of good character development, along with thrills and chills throw in for good measure. If you like the Agatha Christie novels...this one is for you. "
"Akin to a cinematic escape room, A Haunting in Venice stands as the best of Branagh’s trio of recent murder mysteries."
This is the best Christie adaptation from Branagh so far. The Halloween vibes are incredible and Venice is shot beautifully!
The best of the three Agatha Christie adaptations. A suspenseful murder mystery with the perfect amount of horror mixed in. 
"Branagh’s performance and direction provide a level of introspective depth that the standard whodunnit rarely includes or requires, and elevates A Haunting In Venice slightly above the standard detective (and ghost) story."
"Well-designed crime construct and atmospheric ambiance with a sprinkle of supernatural, “A Haunting in Venice” is a hauntingly captivating and credible murder mystery. "
"The gothic setting is unique with cinematographer Haris Zambarloukous' lighting evoking classic noir films. The visuals are actually more intruding than the storyline.
"
"Stark and spooky, Branagh's third Poirot movie successfully adopts a whole new atmosphere. It's less exotic and edgier, more haunted; it's a tense, thoughtful, and satisfying mystery."
"It’s enjoyable, if familiar."
"Like [actor-director Kenneth] Branagh, A Haunting in Venice is both tasteful and tasty. Moody without sacrificing story. Good to the very last whodunnit drop."
"But how does A Haunting in Venice compare to Hallowe'en Party, the novel it's supposedly based on. The movie is actually much better than the book."
"When embittered Poirot's verbose disillusionment with humanity gets too tedious, Branagh relies on production designer John Paul Kelly & cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos to provide sinister, shadowy distractions wafting in Venice's rain-shrouded canals."
"Not the charm you might be hoping for, unless you’re a fan of endless rain, too many jump scares, unsettling camera angles, ragged hand-held camerawork, onerous close-ups, and a score drowning in dreary woodwinds and screechy violins."
"Agatha Christie's famed detective has now solved three cases under the Shakespearean actor's direction, but the latest, starring Tina Fey and Michelle Yeoh, still suffers from rigor mortis."
"Overcomes complex talkiness to get deeper, which is Branagh's mark on the Poirot character. Tina Fey does her best Dorothy Parker, in a positive way, and mystery buffs (who dig the whodunnit) will also dig this combo of jump-scare & detecting. Mustache!"
A Haunting in Venice wears its decadent luxuriousness proudly on its sleeve with the warm lamps throwing sinister shadows that contribute to a glowing gloom as Poirot reveals the dark secrets hidden in normal hearts.
"The blend of the supernatural and the cerebral makes A Haunting in Venice the perfect Halloween treat, one where the line between reality and the supernatural is deliciously blurred."
"Kenneth Branagh’s latest murder-mystery as Agatha Christie’s Belgian super-detective Hercule Poirot turns out to be a bit of a snoozer...A plodding, muddily plotted affair that looks suspiciously like it was designed for small-screen streaming."
"At last Branagh has a sidekick to bounce off in the form of gentle tease Fey, who gleefully delivers put-downs such as describing Poirot as the “number two” greatest detective. They are a fine double act, able to switch tone with ease."
A little horror is a welcome addition to these cozy whodunits.
A Haunting in Venice is cracking good fun.
"Hat tip to Del Toro and company. I like scripts that present a familiar formula in a mystery, and then proceed to have fun with the whodunit."
The script suffers from having an excess of twists executed at a slow pace... [but] the cast never makes it boring. [Full review in Spanish]
"Reptile lets all the drama happen off screen with a third act deus ex machina. What could have been a knotty, suburban, coastal noir boils down to a detective story we’ve all seen before."
"This is a dreary and somewhat tense crime drama that features a fascinating and compelling lead performance. Del Toro crushes it, but the mystery surrounding his character doesn’t quite come together as intended"
"Excellent performances aren’t enough to salvage this labyrinthine slog saturated with equal parts premeditated diversion and gloomy atmosphere. Not even del Toro can make this work.
"
"Though the film’s plot, including its resolution, is routine, Del Toro and Silverstone keep things interesting. I’d love to see them return as these characters in a more compelling story."
A pretty effective murder mystery... [Benicio Del Toro] has aged very nicely into this sort of role. 
"Eventually, Reptile becomes tangled and leaves some of its subplots as loose ends, but Singer’s film is an impressively solid and slimy procedural."
"What begins as a taut crime story ends as anything but. In fact, the finale leaves a couple of questions unanswered.
"
"Grant Singer puts in plenty of nice touches to stress a seedy environment, and del Toro gets a lot of lived-in aspects to his role to play with, but the film still can’t entirely shed the feel of being a “lesser than” attempt at a strong cinematic effort."
" Reptile, whose name is never fully explained, packs quite a lot into the fast-moving story, though at over two hours, it could have been condensed more. "
"It's too convoluted and it feels like a low-rent ""True Detective"". At the heart of it, it could have been fantastic, but the execution of this film was poorly done. "
"Reptile shines in various aspects, and its flaws can easily be overlooked. Watch it for Del Toro's compelling performance and Fincher's influence (particularly in the first half)."
"Some leaps of logic lessen a well acted, twisty thriller."
"Sadly, you still need to stick the landing, and Reptile does a good job of drawing us into the mystery, it just rushes the ending and that feels like a crime."
"Gets points for holding your interest, but loses them for botching the close...it twists itself into such pretzel formations in an attempt to surprise that by the end the ludicrousness has overwhelmed the mood it worked so hard to establish. "
"Benicio Del Toro makes this whole thing work. If it were an hour and a half, it'd be a 4-star. At it's current unwieldy length, it's a 3-star. Still a good watch."
"""Reptile"" isn't a terrible film. There will be a specific crowd that enjoys it. There are just better offerings out there."
"A very absorbing whodunnit procedural assembled with cooly unnerving aplomb, like a David Fincher thriller. "
"Frustratingly, the underlying themes aren't robust enough to make this vastly overlong film very memorable, rehashing the usual exhausted good cop scenario. It's beautifully shot and acted, but a bit more earthy momentum would have given it a real kick."
"Del Toro’s solid screen charisma can’t rescue Reptile, a derivative and lethargic thriller that rarely thrills as it tries and fails to build a case for itself as a meaningful iteration on the detective thrillers that it admires."
After a fast start the middle part falters.
"Like the snake of its title, it slithers ominously enough to send some shivers up the spine. But it’s also a bit too slow and deliberate for its own good, even if its venomous bite can draw some blood."
Benicio del Toro is unsurprising but constantly watchable. It helps that the character’s marriage avoids cop-movie clichés by being fairly happy.
"And in the aimless comings and goings, Reptiles becomes increasingly less attractive. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The film has a concise script, which gradually opens rifts for us to find out along with Tom, from the armchair at home, what is behind the real estate business. [Full review in Spanish]"
The fallout from all this purposeful gloom isn't merely that nothing surprises us; even Del Toro's committed portrayal of a careful man's gathering disillusionment gets jammed up. 
"It's perfectly watchable, but let it play on during the bathroom breaks and search for snacks. It's so slow you probably won't miss anything vital, not until the third act. "
If it more closely focused on Del Toro & Silverstone's mutual deductions on the crimes at hand it may have had something. Instead it feels like all those twisty thrillers in the wake of The Usual Suspects until you're wondering what was all that about.
"Del Toro, who worked on the script crafted by director Grant Singer and Benjamin Brewer, has a meaty role that – like much of the cast – plays him against type."
"It’s handsomely made with strong, committed performances, but it plays so closely to the blueprint that it never establishes an identity of its own."
Benicio Del Toro's magnetic presence is captivating in an atmospheric slow burn that satisfies more as a crime thriller than as a murder mystery. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Del Toro is understated & withdrawn, expertly capturing an inquisitive detective with a damaged past. While the reveal of the mystery does arrive too soon, reducing the impact of the finale, everything that comes before it is riveting with uneasy tension."
"A meandering, routine, mundane slog creating an illusion of thrills when, in reality, nothing interesting is happening"
...stellar acting alone can’t mask most of the shortcomings in Reptile.
"Del Toro carries this sometimes convoluted and derivative thriller into three-star territory with an absolutely mesmerizing and authentic performance that conjures up memories of past anti-hero greats such as Bogart and Mitchum, Ryan and Hayden."
"... The most eccentric character, Michael Pitt's sort of Neo-grunge man with psychopathic traits, makes some of the scenes in the just over two hours sufficiently attractive and inspired to help us get through the end. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Though at times entertaining, the movie fails to escape the shadows of its influences and leaves us with the sensation of a wasted opportunity. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Benicio del Toro's understated performance as a soft-spoken detective is about the only interesting thing about this new Netflix thriller, which drowns a thin murder mystery in lots of ominous atmosphere. "
"The circuitous plotting is hampered by unlikely coincidences that mount before the tangled finale, as Singer's initially promising pulp-noir character piece is buckled by its loftier pretensions."
"This slick and atmospheric murder mystery is best when it’s more about the investigator than the investigation. However, all the melodramatic twists and narrative misdirection can’t disguise the underlying familiarity of the material."
"There is a strange character study yearning to break out of the new Netflix thriller ""Reptile,"" made all the more baffling by the fact that the movie surrounding this character study is a fairly stale crime drama. "
Del Toro and Silverstone make a meal out of what tends to be a pro forma side to these kinds of thrillers
"A good-looking, engaging B-movie made with uncommon intelligence. Music video director Grant Singer’s feature debut is no perfect object, but it is decidedly, and often successfully, aspiring to be something more than just toss-off streaming content. "
"Easily the worst big budget detective thriller since The Snowman a few years back, Reptile eventually lures the viewer in by making them question how this could’ve gone so wrong given the talent involved."
It's easy to admire how Reptile attempts to do things a bit differently  ... It's also easy to begrudge this movie's eventual shift toward the routinely straightforward and the unnecessarily convoluted.
"Reptile gets an extra edge thanks to its rock-solid cast and sufficiently gripping mystery, but it never coalesces into anything incredible.

"
"Less ""whodunit"", more ""who cares?"""
"Reptile’s main strength is del Toro. He shares great chemistry with Silverstone, his co-star in 1997’s Excess Baggage, but it is his character's combination of tenaciousness and eccentricity that are the movie’s most original components."
"Once the film gets around to revealing the culprit, we have already lost interest, enervated in the face of a movie that, like an overeager snake, bites off far more than it can swallow."
"Reptile is an atmospheric Southern crime thriller dripping with an ominous and obsessive style that gradually seeps under the skin, keeping the viewer on edge and making them uneasy. "
"Del Toro doesn’t disappoint. Humorous, serious, determined."
"A solid, gloomy detective thriller that works thanks to Benicio del Toro's stellar performance and the slimy, moody atmosphere created by first-time director Grant Singer. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Elements work in “Reptile,” especially police brotherhood material, but it doesn’t add up to much in this underwhelming study of crime and punishment (and faucets)."
What sets it apart is the strange and slightly offbeat vibe that permeates the entire movie. “Reptile” is very much a crime thriller. But (Grant) Singer takes it in some peculiar and even darkly funny directions.
"Reptile feels as though it’s been through an especially ruthless edit, and it carries the scars of trying to distill a tense tapestry about corruption and morality into something streamlined and easily digestible."
"A distended dirge of digressions & dream sequences that never distract from equally superficial murder plots & psychological profiles. With respect to Benicio Del Toro & Alicia Silverstone’s previous collaboration, ""Excess Baggage"" makes more sense here."
"Reptile, from its score to its performances, is all mood and little else."
The bulky physical presence of Del Toro himself gives the film its momentum and force.
“Reptile” tugs you along with a competent and accessible intrigue.
REPTILE is a murder mystery that packs enough twists and turns to keep even the best amateur sleuth guessing.
The suspense in REPTILE is sustained throughout. The film is an intelligently written murder whodunit that will keep audiences guessing until the very end. 
"Such tension ultimately unravels during a latter half that rushes through too many underwhelming revelations, but that’s not enough to completely offset the film’s beguiling air of despondency."
Reptile just feels wayward and listless.
"Every other actor in the movie — from Timberlake, to Eric Bogosian as Nichols’ boss, to Domenick Lombardozzi as his colleague — seems to have been cast as an irresistible force to be thrown against Del Toro’s immovable object."
The screenwriting trio often leans on perceptions initiated by characters and the actors playing them to present a watchable whodunnit after the early and brutal murder of a real estate agent (Matilda Lutz).
"Reptile is something of a noble misfire, willing to take risks with the genre and its expectations even if the end result leaves a bit to be desired."
"This sleek and noirish whodunit-slash-police procedural is a showcase for Benicio Del Toro but it's incredibly twisty, both a strength and a weakness."
"At the heart of Reptile lies Del Toro’s stellar, captivating performance…[but]what remains is a bloated, maximalist exercise in pastiche, one that is stupidly easy to decipher."
“Reptile” coils itself into many unexpected crevasses.
Characters exist for no reason other than to be suspicious.
"Some elements are overdone, strong decisions are replaced by bad ones, and the final act is a disaster.  [Full review in Spanish]"
"It is a long and boring film, with few other respites from the tedium, but Del Toro, for whatever reason, is just captivating."
Reptile is an empty vessel lacking the creativity to elevate this first feature amongst a stellar year of directorial debuts.
"Offers enough deceit, red herrings, needle drops, and superb character work to make it rise about the usual Netflix suspects. "
"Reptile is a suspenseful, clever, and visually stunning piece of work. "
"In “Reptile” the density is less satisfying than it is irritating. A good thriller can go in lots of different directions, but it should never be this tiresome."
"Attempting to be a sleek thriller befitting of ""The Departed,"" the movie sputters out of control set to the tune of an ear-pinching score by Yair Elazar Glotman. "
"A quirky, darkly comic cop thriller with a knockout performance from Benicio del Toro. "
"Grant Singer’s feature directorial debut suffers from an overinflated sense of grandeur and a frustratingly convoluted story, reaching for dramatic heights that it hasn’t earned."
"In an effort to prove its cleverness, Reptile clanks, rattles and stumbles in its second half. The tricks that initially impressed eventually become hard to endure."
Reptile is a compelling police procedural until it overstays its welcome.
"Wants to be a David Fincher procedural with Steven Soderbergh’s paranoia, but it is a merely fangless homage without suspense, logic, or shame."
"If Reptile sounds like a familiar story to you, that’s because it is. It’s not aspiring to reinvent the crime thriller, and it really doesn’t need to."
It's Godzilla versus the paper pushers-and Godzilla doesn't stand a chance.
"""Godzilla Resurgence"" is a great mainstream film, and probably the most meaningful, visually impressive, and well directed entry in the series."
A special experience. [Full review in Spanish]
Shin Godzilla is the Dunkirk of Godzilla movies.
"The human characters fall flat, and the undeniably dodgy special effects will put many off, but it's an entertaining slice of B-movie nonsense that recalls the earliest days of the iconic franchise."
Movie Review: Shin Godzilla
...quite possibly the best Godzilla film since the first one in 1954.
"Overall, this is a great update to the franchise and I cannot wait to see where they go next with it."
The famed and humongous rumble-and-tumble reptile makes a grand return courtesy of Toho Studios reviving the catastrophic critter in writer/co-director Hideaki Anno's and Shinji Higuchi's monster mash offering 'Godzilla Resurgence' (aka 'Shin Godzilla')
"With its satirical and topical humour, glorious scenes of destruction and a fresh coat of paint, Shin Godzilla [Godzilla Resurgence] lived up to the buzz and exceeded my expectations in every single way."
"The bottom line is that Shin Godzilla is a must-see for any fan of Godzilla movies, but also for people who are simply interested in where Japanese pop culture is headed in the 21st century."
Seamlessly blends majestic spectacle with such resounding soul.
"Thus, Shin Godzilla acquires the epic dimensions of a brutally and joyfully brainless monster movie... [Full review in Spanish]"
Shin Godzilla is a film filled with far more government meetings than Godzilla action. A lack of compelling characters and an abundance of bureaucracy make Godzilla's big screen return a let-down.
Audiences may feel let down by the visualisation of the monster.... Until you realise that's exactly what it is -- a modern tribute to the thoroughly Japanese Godzillas that have gone before.
"What Shin Godzilla does offer is one major counter: Godzilla's real home is Japan, and anything else feels like a glitzy vacation."
"Thirty-one films and 63 years later, the monster has seldom looked better. The final shot will haunt your dreams."
"Directed by Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi, it has an excellent Godzilla, whose rampages are a good mixture of modern and traditional-looking special effects. Often, though, the monster is out of the action."
"Coming off like a peculiar mash-up of The Host and Dr Strangelove, Shin Godzilla is weirdly paced but does add a new twist to the old formula."
"This enjoyable but dialogue-heavy addition to the Godzilla family takes aim at the inert, top-heavy bureaucracy of Japanese government."
"This ambitious reboot of the Godzilla franchise from Toho Studios is a curious beast, but its unconventional nature makes it stand out from the rest of the monster pack."
There are lots of very shrewd and amusing scenes showing Japan's bickering and sclerotic bureaucracy.
Bonkers in all the wrong ways.
"Toho's reboot of its most famous kaiju is, amidst intense monster action, a bitter satire on bureaucracy and a cautionary tale about humanity's collective folly."
The fact that the film features a fictional U.S. President preparing to nuke Japan is a frankly jaw-dropping coincidence. It's both hilarious and terrifying.
"The doc-flavoured approach lends both urgency and tedium, while the blend of miniatures, stop-motion and CGI references the various looks of his 63-year history."
"With the titular beast onscreen for just a fraction of the two-hour runtime, those outside Japan may feel that this latest incarnation of Godzilla is a lot less fun than it should be."
"The 29th Toho film featuring the scaly Big Guy is also one of cleverest and smartest, clearly informed by the Fukushima nuclear disaster and a jaundiced view of do-nothing ""experts."""
Feels more like comprehensive news coverage instead of a monster movie with a linear storyline.
"Godzilla's strange and ever-changing nature goes some way to compensate for effects that are at times decidedly ropey, much as the relentless pace of the action and editing makes up for some very flat characterisation."
A reboot that recovers the original spirit of the saga and applies it to the singular current context. Certainly it has several defects but what it offers definitely deserves our time. [Full review in Spanish]
"A film that marks the comeback of an iconic creature, resulting in almost the opposite of what the American tradition considers a monster movie. It's more like a film about bureaucrats with a monster in the background. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A film that, besides good humor, has some curious political remarks about XXI century Japan that definitely must be highlighted. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A very successful mix between show cinema and fiction television by Aaron Sorkin, which surprises and gives something new to the saga. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It might not climb the mountainous heights of the '54 Godzilla or the 1964 Mothra vs. Godzilla, but it's right up there at the top of the franchise's second tier."
"The special effects seem to very intentionally play into the monster's low-fi roots while also attempting to unsettle, and it's... kind of really effective."
Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi have honored the legacy of Ishirō Honda's classic Japanese film property with the release of Shin Godzilla.
"A combination of thrills, thoughtfulness, spectacle, sentiment and nostalgia, all at once."
"All hail, the King of the Monsters. Godzilla is back."
"As a franchise that desperately needed some form of evolution, Shin Godzilla offers it in a way that is occasionally surprising while also strangely familiar."
"This is the most serious Godzilla film since the first, and except for the novelty the first film had, this would probably be the best Godzilla film ever made."
"Shin Godzilla is a success, blending bureaucratic detail with monstrous mayhem into one exciting package, with enough nods to the original and more than enough originality to let it stand and destroy Tokyo on its own."
The filmmakers' decision to focus less on goofy shenanigans and more on the political costs of a Godzilla attack in 2016 is both surprise and a revelation.
Shin Godzilla is a particularly strong example of a uniquely Japanese genre: the battle of the bureaucrats -- the red tape rumble -- with special guest star giant beast from the deep.
Shin Godzilla makes political restriction the real fire-breathing beast.
Shin Godzilla is a lot of fun if you can focus solely on the monster mayhem. Any sequence involving Godzilla is like a highlight reel of destructive bliss. Shin Godzilla leaves you anticipating where Toho will take this new Godzilla next.
"Godzilla Resurgence may not be Godzilla at his very best but for fans of the giant monster, it's a welcome relief to have him back in Toho Studio's hands"
As a giant monster movie this is gripping viewing from start to finish.
...a conga line of baffling choices...
"One of the most valuable Godzilla movies to come along in years, decades even."
There's one good thing that comes from the occasional American Godzilla film: They get Toho to dust off the property and do it right.
"Shin Godzilla is a true-blue Godzilla movie, and suggests that perhaps Toho has found its best way into a new era, and might have the chance to continue to offer cautionary warnings for generations to come."
"As far as Godzilla movies go, this one is-just as Toho promised-a smashing return to form."
"Godzilla roars back to life in this new Toho Production, but the filmmakers' attempts to teach the old monster some new tricks only partially succeed."
The King Of The Monsters roars back to life in his weirdest movie to date.
"You want to see Tokyo get trashed good, and it does, more cinematically so than in most of the previous franchise installments."
"[I]t repeatedly makes one wonder when the movie is going to get back the big guy, already."
"Takes a more realistic, nuts-and-bolts approach to the eternal question: How do you solve a problem like Godzilla?"
Anno & Higuchi's vision of the character is thoughtful and clever without straying too far from the Godzilla formula established in films like the original 1954 Gojira.
Godzilla ... lumbers through Tokyo in a far less natural way than the days when an actor in a rubber suit stomped on models.
"Anno succeeds in offering a new perspective on the decades-old franchise, without losing sight of what has made Godzilla endure for so many years."
"The film is at its best when it's in parody mode, though it keeps that card too close to the vest for much of its two-hour length."
"Puts a cool, inventive, modern-day twist on the whole concept of a Godzilla flick."
"If you're expecting (or hoping for) the kind of Godzilla movie on the goofier side of things, you might be left wanting, but if you go in expecting a cool, refreshing take on the old paradigm, Shin Godzilla will be a hell of a fun time."
"His most entertaining outings have always come from Japan, and the new ""Shin Gojira"" is no exception."
"The Original Gangsta Lizard gets a largely satisfying reboot in ""Shin Godzilla,"" a surprisingly clever monster mash best described as the ""Batman Begins"" of Zilla Thrillers."
"It's a welcome return for the studio who originated the iconic creature creation, but unfortunately, it never lives up to the drama of the 1954 original, or the bananas fun of all the B-Movie schlock that followed."
"The mother of all allegorical monsters takes on new meaning in a talky, vaguely nationalistic reboot that slips on like a comfortable sweater, even if it's a sweater with some holes in it."
"[The new Godzilla] might serve as a deliberate middle finger to Legendary Pictures' current efforts to Americanize a famously Japanese monster. If one has to pick a side, I side with 'Shin Godzilla.'"
"What sets Shin Gojira apart as its own beast (heh), however, is its heavy focus on the real-world politics involved in such situations of large-scale disaster."
"What is audacious about this remake is not the liberties taken with Godzilla lore, but rather how faithful it is to the canon established by Toho Pictures in the 1950s."
"Toho's 29th entry in the Godzilla franchise may prove too talky for some, but still manages to pay loving homage to the lumbering anti-hero of Ishiro Honda's 1954 classic."
"Those rampages -- staged by effects veteran Shinji Higuchi and his team, with co-director and sci-fi/fantasy maestro Hideaki Anno supervising -- are worth the wait."
"In Triple Frontier, the ‘plot’ aspects of the screenplay work well, but when the characters driving that plot are not fully-formed and layered, it seeps through."
"...just when you think you have it figured out, it throws an unexpected but welcomed curveball."
"Chandor and Boal’s collaboration on Triple Frontier is the first blemish on their practically pristine resumes; a generic, by-the-numbers heist thriller camouflaged with a false social consciousness."
"A lot of talent has been assembled for what amounts to a modest pleasure, and that cannot help but feel disappointing."
Episode 35: Triple Frontier / Climax / Black Mother / Transit
"It might be a premise that's been done to death, but with a fantastic ensemble cast and a series of unexpected twists and turns - with one in particular sure to leave you shell-shocked - this one's well worth its ""weight in gold."""
A timely and heartfelt message deftly delivered.
"Triple Frontier is as good a crime thriller as any movie fan could want, and one that demonstrates that Netflix is staking its claim as one of the premier movie studios."
The strong cast is able to bring enough shadings to their character types to keep our interest and a surprising third act make this a winner.
I am bored when I see the anonymous heroes punished by the mechanisms of insignificant patriotism and the wildest capitalism. [Full review in Spanish]
"On the one hand proving that Netflix is attracting top directors (J.C. Chandor), writers (Mark Boal) and actors (Ben Affleck), while on the other hand presenting a sweeping action-adventure that's reduced on a small screen."
The team's synergy is what keeps us connected.
Triple Frontier stumbles at the finish line.
"Even if the characters' self-righteousness is a bit unconvincing, that's part of the point."
Triple Frontier borrows The Treasure of Sierra Madre's plot but lacks John Huston's fortitude to analyze and rightly judge the mercenaries.
"Chandor teases the possibility of a sequel at the very last, but if this team decide to head back for part two there's quite a bit of work to be done to make it worthwhile."
Poor Affleck mostly hangs in the background while Hunnam and Hedlund do their weird flexing. Ben Affleck ends up being the least-grating actor in the ensemble.
"For some reason, Triple Frontier's militarized masculinity works-in the way old Westerns worked."
There are at least three or four good films buried within Triple Frontier but they went with the surface level stuff and called it a day.
Offers some nice surprises and while it doesn't end in the way you might expect it's an entertaining action drama.
Utterly generic time-killer thriller.
"Triple Frontier is a tense, exciting and dramatic action thriller that takes a fairly basic concept and executes it very well."
"A macho, run-and-gun character study about what happens to the men who fight for this country and its interests when they leave the service and how little they're compensated relative to the sacrifices they make"
"Director [JC] Chandor, in his projects so far, has explored how humans deal with their relationship with the money. Triple Frontier is no exception. This aspect is the strongest character in this intense movie."
"This isn't a home-run for the heist genre, but it's solid. I got what I wanted out of this film."
"I didn't expect too much from Triple Frontier. I can underestimate Netflix movies all I want, but J.C. Chandor uses this film to show me, and the world, that he's truly a force to be reckoned with, and I'll be damned if I second guess him again."
Triple Frontier is nothing if not aggressively competent.
"Still, while it may be a tad uneven, Triple Frontier manages to maintain the audience's interest for its two hour running time."
Triple Frontier is a no-holds-barred action epic with high stakes and major thrills.
Triple Frontier looks and feels like a Stallone/Schwarzenegger film resurrected from the'90s.
"The sequences that take place in the jungle, the plane's crash landing or the shooting in the mountain provide the necessary doses of good entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]"
"If you're a fan of the heist genre, it doesn't hurt to give this a try. If not, skip it."
A heaping plate of meat-and-potatoes comfort food. It's the kind of movie you talk about with your dad.
Triple Frontier goes beyond the heist adventure
"the characters are all standard types who never cut much beneath the surface, which renders the suspense superficial, rather than emotional"
With Chandor doubling as director the movie looks great but makes surprisingly little of the personal conflicts that arise.
"When watching, pretend that Affleck's character is a retired Batman forced to sell condos."
"Though Triple Frontier takes a while to reach the right heightened levels of tension, confusion and aggression promised by Santiago's semi-suicide mission, it does indeed get there in the end."
"The film's attempts at multiple genres may not blend together into a seamless whole, yet the talented cast and strong direction by Chandor help to raise it above its flaws."
"Exciting, suspenseful action tale with violence, profanity."
"A solid, if occasionally clumsy take on the ""big heist goes sideways"" genre. Gets a little credit for not being quite as troop porny as these kinds of movies usually are."
"Alas, just as broken clocks have their moments of accuracy, even the most gifted directors occasionally offer up disappointments. Such is the case with J.C. Chandor's fourth film, Triple Frontier."
'Triple Frontier' should be prime fodder for heist movie fans. There's hardly a dull moment in director J. C. Chandor's film about the unexpected consequences of a jungle robbery.
"The movie struggles because it cannot keep up momentum. It stalls out after the actual heist, which could reasonably find its way into the pantheon of fun action sequences."
We've had this film before. This one just happens to be a more uninspiring and less-than-thrilling version of this particular trope of action films.
"Triple Frontier doesn't entirely manage to transcend the traps of action movie, but there's more to it than meets the eye."
Chandor somehow takes the machismo of '80s action movies and inserts the moral compass of the 21st century.
"Technically profound, yet dense thematically, it's the kind of film that requires a concentrating, engaged audience, which is a harder sell on Netflix than at a crowded movie theater."
This very good analysis of American imperialism and its devastatingly insidious effects on the individuals it ensnares into its web is frustratingly only about half of Triple Frontier.
"Triple Frontier is the lowest point in JC Chandor's filmography, without becoming a mediocre result. [Full review in Spanish]."
"The film feels false in presenting a solid friendship between [the characters]: With men of that ilk, can anything good be expected? [Full review in Spanish]"
The fourth film by J.C. Chandor shows that the director has a good eye for action. [Full review in Spanish]
"Uniquely for Chandor, we've seen it all before."
"Oscar Isaac, Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund and Pedro Pascal. Oh, were you looking for review points as well?"
Triple Frontier is not a waste of your time exactly -- it's a good film to curl up with on Netflix -- but Chandor surely has better movies ahead of him.
"Nothing offered by Triple Frontier is new to its genre, unless it is the exceptional meaninglessness of its central conflict that refuses to justify the stakes it begs for."
The film focuses on the characters and their human dilemmas and turns the fable of the theft of money into a reflection on the limits of actions and their consequences. [Full Review in Spanish]
Triple Frontier works as a hybrid of a quasi-journalistic high-brow military drama and a low-brow men-on-a-mission film.
An epic personalist and chauvinist film. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Triple Frontier could have been a good film instead of the brutal, rigged mess it turned out to be."
Triple Frontier makes a decent stab at looking beyond the usual ambitions of the genre. There's thought behind all this gun-toting.
"Triple Frontier features impeccable photography, strong acting, and well-staged action scenes that ooze tension."
"Comprised so completely of seething, wordless manfeels and tension-breaking affectionate bros before things-that-are-not-bros sarcastic machismo that your media player might as well start emitting the vague scent of leather polish and rich mahogany."
"The Netflix-produced thriller has plenty of shoot-'em-up action, but it's the accounting that will leave you breathless."
"The well-made but frustrating Triple Frontier, which takes its title from the intersection of the borders of Brazil, Peru and Colombia, has almost everything going for it but depth, focus and gravitas."
"From Isaac to Hunnam, [the actors] invest their characters with richer human qualities than the story probably required."
There are some great action sequences in the script.
"Every performance is solid, and you'll be on the edge of your seat, even if you (hopefully) don't buy into the film's moral code."
J.C. Chandor turns an intensely physical narrative into another of his inadvertently generic studies of procedure.
"A movie about super-soldiers going up against the odds might have been formulaic, but it would have been more interesting than this one, which is about tough-talking incompetents."
'Triple Frontier' gets a lot right so it's hard to see why it doesn't quite work.
J.C. Chandor is probably my favorite director of actors working at the moment.
"Though unevenly scripted, Triple Frontier makes good on its grizzled ensemble cast, led by J.C. Chandor's robust direction."
"There are some zippy chase scenes and shootouts, and tension throughout. But the characters - especially the lethargic Affleck - make for more of a C-Team than an A-Team."
"Intense and supremely well made, ""Triple Frontier"" also benefits from nuanced work from Ben Affleck and Oscar Isaac."
I'm a bit of sucker for this kind of material and Triple Frontier -- which wisely places its robbery about midway through -- earns passing grades.
"It's an easily watchable picture, though, particularly with Isaac - who has ascended from quite-good to excellent in recent years - in the lead."
"Triple Frontier never achieves the nightmarish insanity that the premise promises [...] but maybe we're getting a little greedy. This is fun, muscular filmmaking."
"If you're into stories about brotherhood, heists, and survival this is a good one to press play on."
J.C. Chandor's weakest film so far is saved by an excellent cast. [Full review in Spanish]
"There's a meta-narrative in there somewhere, condemning films like Triple Frontier for exploiting the violence of war for superficial ends, but Chandor doesn't delve into self-analysis long enough to make a point about it."
The talented cast elevates a decidedly average plot to one that is worth catching.
"The movie is really just one big lagging metaphor, which is why it comes across as so generic ."
Five leading men head into the jungle with $$ in their eyes. Not all of them return.
"It's as if a much younger Schwarzenegger, Stallone and Willis had gathered together and shot one of their own [films], but with less humor and sadism. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It's the thinking man's action movie, as long as that man doesn't want to think too hard."
They make quite the team - the newest member should be you.
"Despite lacking a profound drama, the film works as entertainment. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"If you dig shoot-'em-up sequences, ""Triple Frontier"" has plenty and they're often the default. Yet what it does well - though not enough - is introduce the complicated motivations of characters and what's led them to this somewhat impossible mission."
"The idea to cast Hedlund and Hunnam as brothers is downright brilliant - if Boyd Holbrook were in this film, it'd be like looking at triplets."
The element of surprise has largely disappeared from modern mainstream moviemaking. And one of Triple Frontier's greatest accomplishments is how confidently it topples the expectations of a wary and weathered audience.
"On a surface level, TRIPLE FRONTIER is an action thriller that provides teeth gritting scenes that cause the palms to get a bit sweaty. To call this film intense is an understatement, but Boal's script just barely scratches the psyche of these guys."
Crime doesn't pay!
"While the action itself is vividly shot and often quite tense, the characters are so thinly drawn that it's impossible to connect with them, much less care about whether they make a clean getaway with their stolen millions."
"An impressive, adult-driven action thriller. Terrifically cast and acted, impeccably directed."
"Director J.C. Chandor's go-big-or-go-home heist film finds its footing for a little while amid a perversely engrossing explosion of opportunity costs. But the rest of this mas-macho meathead stuff just seems simultaneously beneath, and beyond, him."
All is well because Chandor has a way of keeping the action scenes enthralling.
"Triple Frontier says some things about society not valuing veterans enough, about contemporary masculinity and the code of the warrior. While that may not sound very original, it's done in an original way..."
"It's an intriguing, then bemusing, sometimes unintentionally amusing blend."
"Triple Frontier is a tense, dramatic thriller buoyed by a handful of strong performances and a fascinating screenplay by Mark Boal."
"Netflix's new franchise-starter, starring Gal Gadot and Alia Bhatt desperately needed some meat."
"The major problem here is the lack of emotional development for Rachel's character, which takes away the possibility of Gadot becoming a durable action heroine. [Full review in Spanish]"
"This is a perfectly solid action movie, even if it offers nothing we haven't seen a million times before."
"Gadot proves she doesn’t need Wonder Woman to kick butt, but the script is too complicated for its own good. Viewers are used to MI6 secret agents, but when there are super secret agents beneath that, it’s hard to keep track of who’s double-crossing who."
"On the surface, Heart of Stone may come across as just another spy thriller from the saturated genre. But not if one peeks into its heart..."
"While some action sequences feel new and exciting, the rest of—well— everything else, feels like there was no effort put into them."
The film's international cast is a big part of its appeal and neatly fits with the storyline's idea of a non-nation-based spy outfit.
"The problem lies in originality, the lack thereof.
"
"Needed another round with the script to polish up its rougher edges and questionable plot choices, but at least the action scenes make it an average enough weekend time killer."
Will surely be in play for one of the worst films of the year. 
"Heart of Stone, in this instance, is just a disposable product of a highly proposed idea. [Full review in Spanish] "
"The brilliantly-shot action set pieces aside, ‘Heart of Stone’ will disappear into the abyss as yet another forgettable high-budget espionage thriller that splurges on the genre’s opulence."
There’s neither a palpable physicality to the set-pieces nor a genuine hum to the storytelling.
"Harper makes a generic action picture, though a very fun one. Heart of Stone is the kind of movie that audiences watch, have a great time, and forget five minutes after the credits roll. "
"Ms. Gadot is magnetic... and is spinning her wheels in the snow of the Alps, the dust of the African desert and the lava sands of Iceland in an effort to place the cornerstone, so to speak, in the construction of yet another kinetic movie series."
Tom Harper's film could only be more of a Mission Impossible rip-off if it were called Mission Unbelievable.
"Heart of Stone thus serves a stiff offering of spies and twists who instead of suspense, deal in pure automation."
"Like far too many Netflix original films, ""Heart of Stone"" is a star studded, big budget, slickly produced mediocre film. "
The slam-bang stuff in this picture is too tediously routine. 
"Heart Of Stone puts star producer Gadot through her paces in a knock-off espionage thriller that is positioned to launch a Netflix franchise. Feel free to say stop, no more, after this uninspiring introductory experience."
"Heart of Stone starts out decently enough with a big action sequence at a ski resort, but the script goes nowhere new as Stone hops from one exotic location to the next while chases and explosions are thrown in."
"The inert script, soulless characters and vapid MacGuffin plotline that feels like a twice-flushed Bond idea make this high-production-value tale of intrigue and continual action a joyless thrill ride."
"It gets the adrenaline pumping, yet the slick and stylish film is more generic between its kinetic set pieces, leaving Gadot’s compelling character in search of a better movie."
"I will say this though, compared to Red Notice or The Grey Man, which matched the charisma of its stars with the opportunity to be some of the worst-looking $200 million blockbusters one could look at, Heart of Stone at least reads coherently."
Heart of Stone is a Mission: Impossible wannabe that mostly misses.
"A bombastic action thriller that feels like a patchwork of bits and pieces recycled from other, better movies."
"Whew ... it's like folks have never seen an action film before. Standard & redundant after the latest Mission Impossible film, but has legs due to Gadot and Dornan's charms. The action events are decent, yet as always … who is funding these rogue spies?"
"Generic where it needs to be inventive, and fussy where it needs to be streamlined, new Netflix spy thriller Heart of Stone is like a dry-clean-only article of clothing fresh out of a washing machine."
"The fact it is real people leaping out of airplanes, or off the top of a cliff, or riding a motorbike down a snowy mountain gives all of the actions an edge that no C.G.I. can match."
"Despite a surprising twist early on, Heart of Stone features an underwhelming final battle and will ultimately leave you stone-faced."
Apparently AI has reached the Multiplicity stage where making a copy of a copy starts with loglines of Mission: Impossible films and then tries to capture the banality of Ghosted and casting the least charismatic presence of Red Notice.
"There is so much going for Heart of Stone, at least in terms of its essential components, that it is a tad surprising and disappointing that one is eventually left with a nagging sense that the film is not quite all that it could have been."
Will likely have you craving something better the moment those credits roll.
"Everything is very serious, yet Heart of Stone comes across as an involuntary parody. [Full review in Spanish]"
Heart of Stone is too cookie-cutter and uninspired... It isn’t even exciting from a kinetic standpoint: bodies and frames careen down slopes and across tight indoor spaces... further diminish[ing] the stakes without injecting a shred of irony. 
"Spy movies are supposed to be built on intrigue but there’s not much of that to be found in Heart of Stone. As a franchise starter, this Gal Gadot action vehicle fails to ignite."
"""Heart of Stone"" is another bland serving of Europudding... a sloppy, forgettable, and tasteless misfire.

"
"Gadot has charisma, she has impeccable nails and her makeup never smears, and yes, she emphasizes the humorous moments, but everything you see is pretty shallow. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Heart of Stone features an interesting idea or two, but the execution is poor. The twists do not feel earned, and the exciting fight choreography is hidden behind bland effects."
A disposable action film.
Heart of Stone isn't a game changer. But the Gal Gadot-led Netflix flick does offer a solid enough experience -- bolstered by a strong cast and overall good execution -- to justify a watch.
"HEART OF STONE seems to be an attempt to launch a new spy thriller franchise and if this is any indication, it just may take off. It checks the boxes of exotic locations, over-the-top stunts, and a plot in which the fate of the world hangs in the balance."
"Gadot is a pleasure to watch and the supporting cast all chip in. If this is the first in a series of Gal Gadot-led MI-like films, as the producers said when the project was announced, I look forward to the next one."
"The film comes across has hollow and soulless, and I get enough of those in a given year on the big screen that I don’t need to switch over to a streamer to get one more."
"The conquer-the-world machinations, the unoriginal action choreography, the blandly-written characters, and the unstoppable formidability of the superspy make it so hard to care about any of it."
"Heart to Stone progresses into a meandering, padded-out midsection that’s compounded by Harper’s staggeringly bland approach to the material..."
"“Heart Of Stone” purports to have characters made of gritty, golden, unbreakable stuff, but that’s a tagline, not a movie; it’s really just flimsy work easily tossed off as it tumbles into the ever-filling bin of disposable Netflix movies. "
“Heart of Stone” capitalizes on Gadot’s inherent likability... without bringing enough distinctive elements to this exercise to make it feel like much more than a “Mission” wannabe.
The screenplay is a rudimentary thing – scaffolding to support the set pieces – that starts to creak whenever it attempts any depth of character. But the action is terrific...
Heart of Stone is a great movie for your dad to fall asleep watching; not for much else though.
"With all its flaws, it’s ultimately an entertaining film with some beautiful scenery and a solidly satisfying ending."
"The entertainment value is there, as is the star power, but the film never quite digs deep enough into any particular element to make an impact. The result is a slick action film that never has, well…heart"
"There’s a lot to enjoy in “Heart of Stone” if you can kick your feet up, recline back, and toss aside any baked-in preconceptions you may have."
Shoveling down heaps of nothing like Heart of Stone is like chewing through a mountain of cotton balls.
"Heart of Stone certainly doesn’t sink, often flying by with excitement, impressive stunt work, and a solid performance from Gal Gadot emphasizing violence and heart
"
"Heart of Stone is a fun-while-it-lasts kind of summer movie, boasting enough action and thrills to keep you occupied."
"Heart of Stone joins the streamer’s seemingly endless stable of star-driven action films, but it does little to differentiate itself... There’s no big action sequence, or even a single moment that merits any sort of feeling other than déjà vu."
"Paint-by-numbers plot and action collapses under uninspired writing, painful clichés, and overproduced spectacle."
None of the dialogue here is worth listening to; it’s just deadass yammering. 
Heart of Stone is a waste of money on things as grandiloquent as they are dramatically unnecessary. [Full review in Spanish]
"The success of movies like Heart of Stone lies in the ability to provide uncompromising entertainment while also provoking reflection. In this sense, this one accomplishes its mission... [Full review in Spanish]"
"If you’re just watching Heart of Stone between glances from your phone or as you fold your socks, then it’s reasonable to assume that Gadot is a glamorous movie star... But that’s never really good enough."
"Gal Gadot accepts a Mission: Impossible-type job in this potboiler action movie, which justifies its title in a groan-worthy style. "
"Gadot gives a great physical performance but is let down by lacklustre writing and directing. Constant, distracting fight scenes annoy, and somehow old-fashioned imagery of future AI can't hold a candle to the scarier real-world implications of AI now
"
Just engaging enough to recommend it.
"For almost any action in any scene throughout the film, there seems to be someone describing exactly what we’re seeing...it’s so heavy-handed, it feels like the film comes with Cliff Notes."
Another dump from the giant Netflix Originals factory. [Full review in Spanish]
There's plenty of action to enjoy and intrigue lurking around every corner in Rucka and Schroeder’s story about a secret agent who feels like she doesn’t belong anywhere in the world.
"Tom Harper tries to hold things together, but when state-of-the-art tracking technology leads to an online chat that seems straight out of the ‘90s-set Sandra Bullock-starrer The Net, it all feels a little too shambolic and cobbled together."
"Gadot and Dornan are appealing, but this film steals most of its aesthetic and thematic ideas from the Bourne films, which have since been passed by. "
"Heart of Stone becomes overly dependent on increasingly generic, formulaic storytelling, action, and character-building methods, ending up completely devoid of emotion or impactful resolutions."
"While it does get better as it goes along and offers some solid performances from our main leads and some occasional fun action sequences. This, unfortunately is yet another run of the mill forgettable Netflix action film, you've seen 1000 times."
Pretty surprisingly fun spy action movie that's really rewatchable. 
"Director Tom Harper (see 2019’s “The Aeronauts”) does a good job staging loads of gunplay, car chases, a James Bond-like parachuting sequence, and all manner of hand-to-hand combat. "
"This is one of the stronger recent Netflix original films to date, at least from the subgenre one might entitle Action Dramas Featuring an A-List Star That Won’t Be Getting an Oscar Push."
"Heart of Stone is not simply a movie devoid of ideas, it’s a story in active opposition to them."
This Gadot vehicle has neither a single set piece nor performance to make it worth your time.
Heart of Stone is a generic action movie held together by Gal Gadot. That comes together thanks to some inventive set pieces and a committed ensemble cast.
"The film’s vast potential is sabotaged by generic writing.  Despite the considerable charisma of Alia and Gal, Heart of Stone remains strictly average. "
One of the most banal action movies from a Hollywood studio this year.
"An overly calibrated hodge-podge of better movies with absolutely no original thought of its own, populated by stock characters, and brought to life with uninspired filmmaking. "
"Dumb, but watchable. "
"It's the routine of it all that underwhelms in Heart of Stone, a pretty typical espionage thriller with a few moments and ideas that suggest at least some level of creativity..."
Heart of Stone is a decent introduction to a potential franchise thanks to a charismatic leading turn from Gal Gadot and some solid action sequences. 
"Netflix's ​​​​​​​Heart of Stone attempts to put its own spin on a familiar action flick and break through that mold, but its results are mixed.

"
"Even though “Heart of Stone” follows the basic formula, which can result in a passable spy movie, there is simply too much going on."
"The movie is fun, which could be all we need right now. Let’s do it again next summer."
No question Gadot’s presence will mean something here. She brings a level of humanity that lifts the material.
"Heart of Stone is an ideological mess. AI is great until it’s not, and then it’s fine because Gal Gadot can just kick someone in the face. It’s conflicted without embracing that conflict, resulting in a film that’s really about nothing at all."
Heart of Stone is a cliche-filled actioner that is sadly missing its ticker. Gadot is the standout but even she can’t pump much life into the anemic script.
"Heart of Stone opts for broad strokes, which would be a bit more forgivable if the rest of the movie hit the heights it was so clearly aiming for."
"Heart of Stone works like a dutiful, beaten-down undercover agent, on deep background, while you watch something else on your laptop."
I’m open to seeing more of Rachel Stone and the Charter save the world. But I’ll also add that I hope to see Gadot stretch beyond action-hero roles. She’s got the talent for it.
"In a year that has seen some solid action thrillers, ‘Heart of Stone’ pales in comparison."
"Heart Of Stone is a perfectly watchable and often daft bit of fun, but its mission to supersede Ethan Hunt might prove to be impossible."
"All the pieces here are fine but nothing is distinct from dozens of films before it. You would swear that the movie’s star AI wrote it — and even gave itself first billing, too."
"Heart of Stone is a poorly made action. If you want to watch something like Mission Impossible, just watch any of the Mission Impossible films. Why waste your time on a copycat?"
"What makes Heart of Stone frustrating is the inattention to detail – there’s the core of a story here that might have come off, if screenwriter Greg Rucka (rehashing many problems from The Old Guard) had finessed things more intelligently."
"This fun, explosion-packed actioner has franchise potential, but is missing a final ace up its sleeve."
"The film, of course, sets up for a sequel or two, another franchise for the algorithm to chew up, more artificial entertainment to consume, another screen to watch. Next time, we humbly ask, can we get a little more human?"
I thought the whole premise was so ridiculous... I thought it was silly.
It's a really interesting concept that they explore in understated ways. 
"FINGERNAILS does have something to say about modernity's continual perversion of the human experience and the need to dissect, categorise, and package it. Romance is far from dead, but FINGERNAILS takes a forlorn look at what might kill it."
Fingernails has an intelligent central premise and is elevated by its leads who all share fantastic chemistry making their relationships believable. Ultimately some of its ideas feel half-baked.
"Although the premise is perhaps more interesting than the film's execution, Fingernails is nonetheless a bittersweet take on romance that succeeds on the strength of the chemistry between its two lead actors."
"Despite a talented cast, there's no way of getting around viewing this superficial film as anything but trash."
The premise—that a new scientific test can definitively determine whether a couple is in love—is arguably more interesting than the narrative as a whole.
"It’s an exceptional cast, and they fill out the premise with subtle inflections and authentic desire -- the romantic wins out."
"I’m mixed-positive on Fingernails, but I’m absolutely recommending the film because of these terrific performers."
Fingernails has an interesting concept that ultimately falls flat. 
"Charismatic and authentic performances aside, I kept waiting for Fingernails to just go for it, take the big swing, rush to the airport gates, and make the big speech, because surely that's better than waffling for this long."
"Regrettably, the execution feels too slick and fabricated to convey authenticity, the romance comes across as feeble, and the emotions fail to reach the heart. Alas, I didn't buy a word of it."
I think the main fault of this film is not much is explained. especially the technology that is supposed to measure compatibility... I did enjoy the acting but they needed to explain a lot more.
"Nikou’s sci-fi drama is more failed experiment than a fine, or redefining, romance."
"Fingernails is a cute enough film...If you are in the mood for something cute that does not require too much from you, or you want to fall in love with Riz Ahmed, then it’s worth a watch."
"Fingernails won’t satisfy both hearts and minds at the level of its masterful predecessors, but Nikou has written and directed a moving, thought-provoking film. "
Fingernails relies on soft mood sand feelings without imbuing them with proper depth.
"Fingernails has a preachy message about how love is inherently risky. With no emotional payoff, its inane and implausible plot points add up to a plodding, pompous film."
The restrained performances reflect the emotional numbness of this life.
"That provocative element is in those touches where it references other films... when our relationships don't seem to match what we see in those films, when the feelings aren't as strong or as definitive, that's when the doubt creeps in."
"Despite reliable actors being engaging throughout, this movie lacks curiosity about its ideas to where I only grew more and more frustrated. It’s not a good sign that you don’t experience any feeling whatsoever watching this letdown of a film about love."
A softer version of Yorgos Lanthimos’ The Lobster...
"For all its whimsy, Fingernails is delicately profound. Its characters aren’t making bold romantic moves; they’re interrogating their assumptions of what is ultimately an unknowable phenomenon."
There are a couple of amusing moments but the film never quite jells as either comedy or romance. I was ready for it to wrap things up a good half hour before the end.
"Even its central physical provocation feels tame and held-back, as if to promise a genuinely challenging exploration of love that Nikou’s film can’t muster up the courage to actually become.
"
"As science fiction goes, it is a look into the malfunctioning near future of our society. With an epidemic of loneliness gripping the country...I can see where the idea for “Fingernails” found its seed, but it still makes me wince."
"This witty, tender film casts quite the spell, and Buckley and Ahmed are wonderful together."
"“Fingernails” won’t be for all tastes, but I found this gracefully acted, lightly dusted sci-fi drama to be one of the most refreshing films about love in a while."
"This cleverly offbeat affair might have its flat spots, but it does have plenty to say about the pressures people face in keeping relationships alive and nurturing. The ever-expressive Buckley, as always, reigns supreme in the lead role."
"There is a missed opportunity here to have explored things about the process that Christos Nikou and his co-writers developed. I wanted a little bit more out of this film, but Fingernails is still worth a watch."
"By not doing enough to explore the rules, that they’re ultimately broken by the characters feel romantically inert."
"Nikou, like most of us, does not have the key to the secret [of love], but his film at least reflects, like any good mirror, that feeling of fragility that fills us when we consider the object of our desire... [Full review in Spanish]"
Greek director Christos Nikou and his co-screenwriters Sam Steiner and Stavros Raptis make some intriguing propositions in their screenplay... But what their script lays the foundations for are some exceptional performances from the trio of leads.
"As a critic, I've seen wretched sci-fi romantic dramadies - but few as ludicrous and repugnant as this...Jeremy Allen White's & Riz Ahmed's roles are so superficial and Jesse Buckley wears a garish hairstyle/fright wig. Why?"
"Just when you think 'Fingernails' is ready to divulge the answer to what it feels about the game of love and the roles we play, it pulls back and elects for ambiguity."
"This refreshingly honest take on relationships with a unique sci-fi edge rests squarely on the shoulders of Jessie Buckley, Riz Ahmed, and Jeremy Allen White in one of the more compelling love triangles put on film. "
"Despite the incredible cast, the chemistry between the leads, and the premise, Fingernails suffers at the hands of pacing."
"While it might provoke thought-provoking conversations about love in the modern era and the nature of relationships, the high-concept, deadpan rom-com from the Lanthimos protegee contains little insight and intuition."
"The more you think about this alternative world, the more the conceit loses its shape, until the film is taking a poke at only the most lukewarm romantic expectations. "
"I’d happily watch Buckley and Ahmed read the phone book; they both possess the kind of pensive eyes and ambiguous half-smiles that serve as catnip to funny-sad auteurs. But, like Anna, you can’t help but want a bit more eventually, too."
"Fingernails appears to be arguing for people to cast aside their attachments to technology and embrace the uncertainty that comes with following their hearts, but this is a long way to go simply get people to delete Tinder from their phones."
"It’s an interesting premise, the performances are strong and it’s a tight, disciplined story that doesn’t tangent off. But it can feel a little cold even though the always wonderful Jessie Buckley has good chemistry with Riz Ahmed. "
"   The chemistry is certainly there in the form of Jessie Buckley and Riz Ahmed. But the accompanying physics are absent, as Nikou and his co-writers struggle to exert gravity on a conceit so light and airy it repeatedly threatens to float away. "
Fingernails lacks the leak-proof internal logic that’s necessary to persuade an audience to fully commit to an outlandish central premise.
"It's minor in the end, but Buckley and Ahmed are such decent actors that you want them to pull off the final reel, and they mostly do"
...an incredibly stupid premise that’s employed to pervasively (and astonishingly) underwhelming and tedious effect...
"FINGERNAILS adds a science-fiction spin to the old romantic triangle plot, with the actors doing what they can with a dodgy script and director/co-writer Christos Nikou’s slow pacing. "
Fingernails falls into the trap plaguing so many recent observations of man versus machine.
We have all become closed off and emotionless when it comes to dating and this film is a reflection of that.
The wonderful acting adds to a quietly quirky romance about the arithmetic of love.
"Despite a sharp cast, the film struggles to coalesce its thematic ambitions and intentionally ridiculous contrivances. Meant to playfully tweak imperfections in dating and romance, it comes off rather shallow and emotionally distant."
"Nikou’s film is wonderfully astute on love’s unruliness: it wants you to both delight in and despair of it, and have fun doing both."
"The film can be thoughtful when its reasonably compelling ideas don’t get in their own way, or when it’s not inspiring Ahmed – so great in Sound of Metal – to give a near-anonymous performance."
"Two Oscar nominees, Jessie Buckley and Riz Ahmed, give us much hope as co-workers at a futuristic ""love institute,"" where couples are schooled and then oddly and gruesomely tested to see if they are truly the perfectly compatible match."
"... Can love be a science, anyway? These are the interesting questions posed during this gentle, well-acted piece of work that, sadly, never quite pulls on the heart strings enough."
"Nikou stays strange in this swatch of right-now-futurism, but also expands on his vocabulary of crunchy yet seductive imagery from <I>Apples</I>."
"Nikous unfortunately doesn't take full advantage of a great idea and a stellar cast, and delivers a movie that never quite reaches full speed. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The Institute of Love plot here, the narrative body of the movie, is mostly pointless and sometimes grating."
"There is a surprise or two in store during the film’s third act, though the conclusion is hardly shocking. However, there is a sense of the vicarious to be had. "
Fingernails is funny until it’s not: deeply romantic from the top of your head to the end of your fingernails.
But analogue passion needs a better advert than Anna and Amir. Their will-they-won’t-they might leave you shrugging. And wondering when Hollywood forgot how to make love stories big enough for movies.
"There are too many interesting questions to call the whole a failure and too many holes and distractions to deem it a success. Regardless, I do think it's worthwhile."
"The whole fingernail business also can feel like a gimmick that challenges credibility, and perhaps even common sense. That’s how I lean."
"It's hard not to wish Fingernails had grander designs. It shows just enough of its potential to leave us wanting those ideas expressed more fully.

"
Fingernails delivers a beautiful and eccentric articulation of the painstaking feeling of throwing yourself into the romantic unknown.
"Although engaging at times, Fingernails is ultimately frustrating."
"Filled with an offbeat insight, this smart, provocative, and moody sci-fi romance has a flair for the absurd. "
"Fingernails is like the appendage that it is named after — increasingly irritating to deal with, and ultimately destined to be discarded."
"Fingernails is captivating thanks to Jessie Buckley and Riz Ahmed, who are skilled actors finding chemistry in each stare and smile."
" sweet though predictable, as instinct and emotion eventually triumph over machine. Yet, because the film itself knowingly abounds in cliches (the student-couples watch Hugh Grant romcoms...), its sentimentality, while corny, always feels fitting."
"The film is successful because it manages to create its own logical, nonsensical rules, which love then snaps."
"A movie for cynics as much as romantics, Fingernails is no empty-headed Hollywood rom-com, or love-lorn dramedy."
"It’s not the familiarity of this setup that irks, but its silliness. "
"Boasting a sense of aloof, cold detachment and stream of consciousness word salad dumps of pesudo-philosophy disguised as meaningful dialogue, Fingernails is a film that thinks very highly of itself without realizing it’s a gigantic bore."
"A searching, gently melancholy romantic drama that recognises, when it comes to love, we are often left with more questions than answers."
"Here's a story that revolves around a gimmick that doesn't make much sense, isn't developed in any meaningful way, and doesn't seem to really matter..."
"Jessie Buckley and Riz Ahmed make the characters more interesting than the scripted story they appear in. There is a hint of romantic warmth here, and it all comes from them."
"Heartache and horror walk hand in hand in “Fingernails,” a disarmingly sweet science-fiction romance from the Greek director Christos Nikou."
"The trajectory is rarely in doubt and the film leaves much to mine when it comes to its premise. But whatever the weaknesses of Fingernails, Ahmed and Buckley and their thrilling rapport more than overcome."
It is the intelligence and delicacy of the acting which keeps this wobbly contrivance steady.
"Fingernails makes pointed and thoughtful observations on love, but the whole ordeal strains belief, even if the ensemble does a solid job trying to sell it
"
"“Fingernails” is an odd one, but not off-putting for the most part, with Nikou clearly looking to make something slightly peculiar about a universal experience."
"“Fingernails” is a film about the nature of relationships, yet it seems to know little about them."
A soulful riff on the cynical Black Mirror formula.
Jessie Buckley and Riz Ahmed star in this dystopian romance about using science to determine if couples really belong together -- a movie you may have trouble falling in love with.
"There’s nothing particularly astonishing, interesting or new about Fingernails, or the way that it approaches the topic of love."
"Buckley and Ahmed are exceptional together, with White’s understated nice guy serving as a sturdy and pitiable third side to this strange love triangle."
"As it stands, it’s a very dreary quirk-fest, one that lacks both the all-out weirdness of Yorgos Lanthimos’s similarly themed The Lobster and the conceptual rigour of Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind and Her."
"Sensitive writing and directing provide insight alongside adept, nuanced performances from Jessie Buckley, Riz Ahmed and Jeremy Allen White."
"What a pleasure it is to watch a film like this, where every shot has been composed with care and craft."
"For all the feelings Fingernails conjures, one can’t help but feel empty upon its end, which suggests the only remedy for heartbreak and to a larger extent, loneliness, is finding someone new on which to project their own ideals and dreams."
"The bar is sky high, but this is the best performance of Buckley's career... [Full Review in Spanish]"
"And it is there, in the subversion of genres, that Fingernails finds its place and reveals falling in love from a respite while offering a critical look at dependence on technology. [Full review in Spanish]"
"There’s an endearing bizarreness to Fingernails... that allows him [Nikou] to grasp at some of the intricacies of the human condition, steeped in silences as much as heartfelt analysis."
Love becomes a game of percentages in this intriguing alt-world sci-fi drama.
"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’s introverted gothic sister, Fingernails employs a sweetly laid, nimble metaphor to explore both the complacency in relationships and the arbitrary ties that bind."
"The premise behind “Fingernails,” though, especially the titular part..is so silly it is difficult to figure out just what Nikou is satirizing.  In the end, it merely seems the obstacle to what turns out to be an otherwise traditional romantic comedy"
"Fingernails finds itself on an all-too predictable route, albeit one that's enjoyable enough thanks to three strong lead performances and some charming retro-futuristic sci-fi flair."
"It may be a story about the unknowability of love, but its pulse never races — it doesn’t pick up at all."
"Directed and co-written by Christos Nikou, Fingernails plays with an intriguing original idea but never loses the attention of the audience. "
"To say Die Hard still holds up is an understatement: charismatic protagonist and antagonist, great action set pieces, well paced and a top class finale. It’s no wonder so many other films and TV series continue to “do a Die Hard”, it’s still hard to top."
"Top to bottom, it is just endlessly entertaining and well-crafted with outstanding work from all involved. No matter how much action movies have continued to grow, this will always be the cinematic elder statesman that can scrap with the best of them."
"That’s right, I’m saying it, loudly and proudly, since John McTiernan’s 1988 action classic isn’t just set at Christmastime—it embodies the very spirit of the holiday."
"The gold standard for action filmmaking; what action movie tropes Die Hard doesn't follow, it reinvents or altogether originates, and all of them have yet to be bettered."
Give Die Hard a fresh spin this year; it's the most joyous Christmas film of all! 
I really appreciated the interpersonal relationship between him and his wife. It wasn't slow but it was taking its time.
[It] may be the best action movie EVER.
"It's another anti-cheer holiday selection, but one that keeps on giving - rewatchable sans saturation..."
"Sometimes-more often than not, even- a script with many hands on it becomes a case of too many cooks. With Die Hard, competing experienced creatives produced a film that works on multiple levels."
"Still the prototype of the modern action yarn -- its status was secured so rapidly that subsequent action romps were invariably described as ""Die Hard on a train / plane / bus / zeppelin / tricycle / what-have-you."""
"Die Hard is not only an excellent action film, it is an excellent film overall and its ability to stand the test of time and still hold up is admirable."
"A spectacularly thrilling film, possessing enough brains to match its brawn."
"The picture is extremely violent: bombs go off, bullets rip through flesh, heads are slammed against steel. But Die Hard is also smart, satirical-and, in an odd way, heartwarming."
The director's spectacular ability to compose the plans and take advantage of the full range of the panoramic format possibilities. [Full Review in Spanish]
"It's a glorious scene-stealer for Alan Rickman, though it's a credit to Willis's cheeky charisma that his scene is not in fact stolen."
Die Hard is a great example of the Hollywood studio system getting moviemaking right - the film is a perfect storm of story and talent coming together.
Die Hard still feels as fresh and thrilling as the first time it screened.
"From the superb pacing through to the sarcastically sinister villainy of Alan Rickman, this remains a crucial template for the modern action film."
It's as though the filmmakers approached each scene by asking themselves how entertaining they could make it.
One of the very best action pictures of all time... Yippe-ki-yay indeed.
"Die Hard is film's equivalent of a terrorist attack on your senses, but Willis' intensity and presence push it into guilty pleasure territory."
"What sets 'Die Hard' apart from most action movies is the depth of characterization. [Detective John] McClane is not a macho toy with a bullet-proof body. He is a thinking, feeling man who can't believe he's doing most of what he does."
"Here, postmodern architecture meets Reagan-era Hollywood cinema and makes lots of movie magic."
"Exciting, tense, expertly edited and directed, full of well-constructed characters and lots of action. [Full review in Spanish]"
"There are good performances from everyone in this long, often funny, very violent but exciting melodrama."
A masterpiece of populist filmmaking.
"Yippee-ki-yay, action fans."
"Within the narrow framework of the hard-action genre, Die Hard is almost as good as it gets."
Willis gleefully strips down the action movie to a pretend game for children who like to fire guns and shoot bad guys. Machismo may never be the same.
"Die Hard is probably the most manipulative movie I've seen this year, but since it makes no bones about being manipulative and does it so well, this not only isn't a problem -- it's fun."
"Die Hard is an action picture with a capital A. In fact, you might as well go ahead and capitalize the whole darn word."
"As a grand flourish of cinematic technique, it is awesome; as a human drama, it is disgusting and silly, a mindless depiction of carnage on an epic scale."
"The very pinnacle of the '80s action movie, and if it's not the greatest action movie ever made, then it's damn close."
"Most of the action is run-of-the-mill Hollywood blood and thunder, but a couple of scenes are unusually reprehensible."
"McTiernan, who directed last summer's Predator, composes the action cleanly and logically, making good use of Jackson DeGovia's elaborate post-modernist set-the building becomes something of a character in itself."
"DIE HARD is a classic film. Simply put, every single thing works."
... Not only the best action movie ever made but one of the very best of any genre.
"John McTiernan's thriller-actioner is well executed, boasting a strong performance from Bruce Willis, which made him a big-screen star."
Original Bruce Willis violent actioner.
High-tech cartoonish action thriller.
"In the first half of Director John McTiernan's movie, Willis wears an undershirt. In the second half he gets rid of it. And that's pretty much it for his performance."
"Die Hard is as high tech, rock hard and souped up as an action film can be."
A serviceable if rather overextended and overblown adventure thriller.
...remains one of the most entertaining and flat-out thrilling examples of the action genre...
"Great escapist action, but it's still nothing more than an action movie %u2013 cinema's version of a nice, tasty hamburger."
"A seminal action film that created an entire subgenre. Super action, but the key to its success is how it effectively pits Willis' common-man hero against Rickman's haughty arch-villain."
A hi-tech thriller with a human heart.
Every so often a movie comes along whose concept sparks a flood of imitators. Die Hard is such a movie.
""
'A landmark film that breathed life and originality into an area of cinema where only formulas were proven reliable.'
An explosion-movie classic.
"Superior star vehicle, but utterly insubstantial."
There's a reason why this film's basic premise has been transplanted to every kind of building or transport known to man: it's just that good.
An ingenious and ceaselessly self-renewing thriller that surpasses every seeming limitation.
"Marks the peak of the 1980's action boom that made mega-stars out of the likes of Ah-nuld, Stallone and Van Damme."
"The scenes move with such relentless energy and smashing special-effects extravagance that Die Hard turns out to be everything action-genre fans, and Bruce Willis's relieved investors, might have hoped for."
A landmark action film.
The best action-thriller of the 20th Century...Willis is THE Man~
"Rent it on Christmas Eve and give that ""Wonderful Life"" [expletive deleted] a rest for one year."
Slower to get going than I remembered -- and that's a good thing
"Die Hard is in many ways the perfectly constructed action film, combining interior tension with exterior explosions."
Bruce Willis discovered his movie legs in this superb action movie.
"For an evening of edge-of-your-seat entertainment, you’d be hard pressed to do much better."
"It may seem, in measure, that watching this in lieu of Frosty or Rudolph violates a practice during a holiday known and based on custom. However true, there is a discernable heart in Die Hard."
"...practically reinvented the action thriller, or at least resuscitated a moribund genre."
"The granddaddy of a whole genre of action films still remains sharp, tough, and exciting."
"A perfect action movie in every detail, the kind of movie that makes your summer memorable."
"an intelligent game of cat-and-mouse, complete with some proposterous situations, a lot of carnage, some male bonding, one strong woman, lots and lots of one-liners, and it even has a villain coming back from the dead for one last kiss goodnight."
"For what it is, this is the top model -- flash, bang, and witty one-liners all included."
Inappropriate and wrongheaded interruptions reveal the fragile nature of the plot and prevent it from working.
"It's good, dumb fun."
"It gets your heart pounding, then makes you hate yourself for it."
Gabe Polsky’s adaptation of John Williams’ novel is driven by a fierce performance by Nicolas Cage as an Ahab-like hunter who’s intent on wiping out a herd of buffalo in a remote Colorado valley. 
"[Fred] Hechinger impresses as the fish out of water, but it's Cage's enigmatic steeliness that carries the film whenever the plot meanders in its attempt to deconstruct the mythology and morality of the Old West."
Polsky’s script and cast can’t quite match the visual clarity he gives the tale.
"Butcher’s Crossing is a decent western, with decent performances. It’s a film that delivers what’s expected.  But it could have been so much more."
"…has a dark style and heart-breaking sense of hard-scrabble endurance that only a real adventure can provide, and that’s largely due to Cage’s magnetic presence…."
"Butcher’s Crossing is a simple but solid Western with beautiful locations. Cage turns in another intriguing performance to go along with his recent output, even though Miller never quite pops as much as he should."
The film doesn’t really know what it is or who it’s for.
Butcher’s Crossing never fully completes the psychological factor it desperately needs to connect and meet the film’s weighty themes.
"The man vs. nature and man vs. man themes come through in this respectable effort, but “Butcher’s Crossing” is a grim viewing experience."
"This grim, pessimistic Western at times feels a little inert and uneven; it might have had more thrust, more madness, but it still captivates with its powerful visuals and fine performances. "
"Not at all action-packed, this is a compelling enough psychological journey that could have excelled further were it to really focus on what impact these men were having on land they did not cherish enough."
"Polsky has great admiration for his source material and his cast, and fails them both through his attempt to give them too much dignity."
"Fear, anxiety, and dread drive Gabe Polsky’s bleak drama which resembles the dark revisionist Westerns from the 70s and 80s, from the Eastwood films to the horror-tinged “The White Buffalo.” Solid cast with Cage delivering a low-key performance. "
"For the completists of Nicolas Cage -a captivating presence, as always- and those enamored with the natural world -vividly captured through beautiful photography- that can deal with the buffalo hunting sequences. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The film’s hints of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Moby-Dick and The Old Man and the Sea lend some much-needed weight to what would otherwise be a pedestrian story of men fighting the elements and one another. "
"Butcher's Crossing is a solid film held back by a below average script. Buffalo hunting is the central plot, but the characters make the film shines.

"
"Butcher's Crossing is a parable of greed, arrogance, and humanity's unquenchable thirst for blood. Good performances overcome uneven pacing. A solid second act emphasizes character development and lifts the film."
Cage is welcomely understated in a performance that is all the more impressive for his avoiding his trademark excess.
"Deconstructing mythology and morality in the Old West, this deliberately paced drama weaves its rugged frontier landscapes into a harrowing story about actions and consequences."
"‘Butcher’s Crossing’ offers remarkable footage and an important message, but narratively, the film doesn’t quite make the cut."
"“Butcher’s Crossing” is unfocused, distant, and flat."
"It's not a rootin' tootin' Old West good time, but for Cage fans, this is an interesting enough look into the harsher elements of frontier life in a role that plays to the actor's strong suits."
"Gabe Polsky's BUTCHER'S CROSSING is a familiarly harsh depiction of men going against nature with nothing but greed, vengeance, and hubris in their hearts."
"The performances are authentic and nuanced, especially from Cage who is surprisingly (and effectively) restrained. And the stunning cinematography not only captures the natural beauty of the setting but also the remoteness of an untouched countryside."
Nicolas Cage is not only riveting but also surprisingly restrained in the unsettling new western Butcher’s Crossing.
"Butcher’s Crossing is not the freshest of Westerns, but it does offer some bleak and gnarly imagery, gorgeous vistas, and Nicolas Cage in a subtle but poignant performance."
"A strong showcase for Cage, who delivers a powerful performance."
"The narrative is simple and stretched out which can make it feel slow and repetitive, but the film is never dull or boring. The unique storytelling angle is what makes this an interesting addition to the Western genre. "
"“Butcher’s Crossing” is a tightly spun, well-acted, beautifully shot and unforgiving slice of Old West madness."
"Butcher's Crossing can't muster much more than to point out that the legend of Old West isn't all that's cracked up to be, and at this point, that's not much of a point in the first place."
It’s a mostly well-crafted film with decent visual scope. The film’s greatest flaws are in Cage’s shakily written character...
"Though “Butcher’s” has its share of conflicts and drama, it can move as slowly as the glaciers that cut its imposing scenery."
"While Polsky delivers some gorgeous vistas of the Montana shooting locations, he can't translate Williams' story into equally powerful drama."
The film offers Cage a rarity for someone at this stage of his career; a new challenge in a new genre.
"A slow-burn descent into insanity, and this strange balance of history and psychological horror keeps “Butcher’s Crossing” involving despite its grim premise."
"Unfortunately, like the buffalo, the film just roams
"
"A B-western, but not particularly exciting or thrilling."
" The big setting, big themes and big star’s subtle turn as a blowhard more misguided than manic are enough to put this Western over."
"Bald and bearded, Cage is typically magnetic as the Ahab-like Miller, whose obsessive quest to slaughter a valley full of bison for their hides slowly drives everyone insane."
"If its characters were more boldly drawn, Butcher’s Crossing could have been a major addition to the neo-western canon."
"Uneven, but good enough to survive the hunt."
A compelling film that brings to life a side of the cowboy genre not often explored.
"Polsky’s film is clearly running up the clock in a way that makes me feel like there just wasn’t enough material to warrant a full-feature film, but features a fantastic, biting performance from Jeremy Bobb. "
"For all it aspires to say about the foolhardy nature of those seeking purpose in the west, Butcher’s Crossing lacks the patience to follow through when it counts."
"Nic Cage is unrecognisable, but this new western unfortunately fails to live up to its potential. It continues the strong streak Cage is having in his career at the moment, but would have benefitted from some narrative restructuring."
"While doing the original Butcher’s Crossing justice would be difficult under most circumstances, the end results can be chalked up to the source material being simply too good, too graceful for talent this amateurish."
"Though solidly made, it’s a Western without enough fire or novelty to attract a great deal of interest, though its two leads should keep it from getting lost in the crowd completely."
"The supporting cast delivers fine work, even though most of the characters feel surface-level. The same sentiment can be extended to the film itself, a merely fine accomplishment that fails to dig deeper beneath intriguing themes."
A sturdy and subdued Nicolas Cage leads the otherwise rocky adaptation of John Williams’ western novel.
A film that’s just too inert and too superficial to dig into the deep philosophical underpinnings of its source.
Butcher's Crossing is not the typical Western that one thinks of when it comes to the genre.
"As a character [Will Andrews], his hero’s journey isn’t engrossing. He’s the subject of this movie and isn’t portrayed as an observer but a background character in his own story. "
Butcher’s Crossing benefits from a seriously commanding Cage performance...
"A severely principled Western tale with clear, to the point of being obvious, points to make about the evils of plundering the land. The reasons are not limited to Manifest Destiny, capitalism and macho pride, but those are probably the big three."
'Butcher’s Crossing' is a gorgeous travelog and a warning about what happens when people fail to tread lightly in the natural world.
"A bleak, abstract Western. "
"While it might set itself apart from many superhero movies that came before it, it seems to do so arbitrarily as opposed to exploring those ideas in any organic way. "
"Man of Steel was Snyder’s triumphant debut with Superman, and it’s still a thrilling example of why Clark Kent can be an engaging lead for one of these movies despite the speculation for the opposite.

"
Man of Steel is fun and makes a lot of sense a lot of the time but is also dull and senseless some of the time.
"You finish watching, hoping that better times might just be ahead ..."
"Snyder’s film is humorless and flavorless, unmemorable and underwhelming, epic-sized but far from grand."
It’s a movie that offers a unique vision laced with fun summer action while also showing a level of respect for the source material.
"If there is one word to describe Man of Steel, it would be a disappointment. "
"Here is the main problem: it is a solid movie, but a terrible Superman movie."
"Man of Steel gets a lot right. The casting of Henry Cavill as Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent is spot-on. He brings the right notes of heroism and earnestness to the role, as well as embodying the physical presence of the character."
"While Cavill never really gets a chance to make the film his own, the quality of the performances are enough to salvage the film's many shortcomings."
A more sincere Clark Kent derivation.
A reminder that it takes a whole lot more than muscle and strength to make a true superhero.
"Zack Snyder makes his film feel more human, more emotional and more heroic than any other Superman adaptation on the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It may not have lived up to the hype, but Man of Steel is still the best modern Superman movie, and well worth checking out even if the screenplay delivers its fair share of disappointments. Still, this feels like a solid opening chapter from Zack Snyder."
"In this quick fast episode, I go into a bit more on why I dislike the Man of Steel film"
"A pandering, monotonous mess that features an anachronistic character who may be best left a relic of the past."
"Man of Steel is admittedly missing humor and fun, consumed by the seriousness of producer Christopher Nolan's dark overtones and grey color palate. But the tone was a course correction, and the payoff is great."
"It's curious how the abstraction of CGI carnage and the abstraction of plot verbiage seem to go hand in hand. But one thing missing from this resolutely earnest film is humour, which is odd when you consider it's based on a comic book."
"Arguably the most satisfying, complex, and entertaining feature film ever created featuring the superhero."
"Henry Cavill breathes new life into the Man of Steel, the most realistic version of Superman we are going to ever get."
An event movie that is actually an event.
The scenes between Russell Crowe's Jor-El and Michael Shannon's glassy-eyed Zod crackle with tension and drama that the scenes with Henry Cavill's Superman just can't match.
Snyder needs to learn the art of subtlety.
Man of Steel ultimately fails because it forgets its origins. It's a film full of angst and devoid of humor.
"Man of Steel isn't going to win over those who are indifferent about Superman, but it does set the stage for future films with more interest in character than in spectacle."
"Shannon is no great shakes as the shouty villain and Adams does little with a thankless role. As for Cavill, he certainly looks the part but lacks crucial charm and charisma, surely the two essential qualities any Man of Steel needs,"
"Man of Steel is grandeur and epic, but it's also deep and personal."
This is an origin story that is rooted outside the actions of one-Clark Kent is not really even the central figure molding it.
The key to great Superman stories is to have ones that give Superman a deep and complex problem that speaks to society at large. Man of Steel successfully reinvented him for the 21st century.
Man of Steel's schizophrenic structure acts as a microcosm for both the profoundly philosophical and the profoundly thuggish dialectic at the heart of the Superman legend.
"The ending is particularly ridiculous, with a series of lines that the screenwriters obviously liked but couldn't fit in anywhere else."
"The movie is stylish, entertaining, suspenseful and spectacular...oh and it's also two hours and 28 minutes long. It would be nice to save the world and get the girl in less than two hours."
"What's there is good, but needs more built on top of it. Instead, Snyder fills the rest of the runtime with action spectacle."
Being an alien among humans is scary and director Zack Snyder drives this point home showing the world through a young Kent's eyes.
"Man of Steel is a slightly flawed and far from perfect modern telling of the Superman myth, but ultimately is a fun and engrossing reinterpretation of the character."
Beats its bulletproof chest too mightily and too long.
"Driven by fantastic performances and a confident script, Man of Steel manages to both capture the imagination and ground the character in the modern-day."
"If superhero movies were once plagued by excessive silliness, Man of Steel suffers from an excess of dignity."
My honest opinion? I loved this movie.
The Superman movie I've always wanted to see on the big screen. A brilliant modern take on the iconic hero. [Full review in Spanish]
"At first pass it works but upon revisiting it, it just doesn't hold up."
"This Superman has the rare ability of making us look back fondly on 2006's nostalgic Superman Returns-a film that elicited a nearly universal ""meh."""
"Too many amazements can lead to audience exhaustion, especially when the film runs more than two hours."
Man of Steel is the movie of the summer. It's the Superman movie we deserve. And it's about time.
Snyder is an adrenaline junkie forever jonesing for a fix; he does less building to the action beats than backing each one into the next.
"A curiously empty exercise in blockbuster filmmaking, Man Of Steel is full of sound and fury signifying... you know what."
"A hugely impressive and entertaining story of arguably the most powerful character in the superhero pantheon (and also one of the biggest pop culture icons), it's clear that the Man of Steel is here to stay."
"I'm excited to see where Man of Steel goes, now that it's accomplished its own bit of world building. There's every reason to expect the inevitable sequels will be better."
What's missing in Snyder's Superman is a dash of the hokey goodness that Christopher Reeve contributed to the role and the comic cold cheesiness that Gene Hackman and Terrence Stamp brought as Luthor and Zod.
"Man of Steel is a very good superhero movie, but it's not necessarily a fun superhero movie."
"I wish it had done more than just include lots of shots of people looking reverentially up in the sky, but it does open up some promising avenues for the series going forward."
It's bland and boring.
[Henry Cavill's] only apparent superpower is boring the audience.
"Man of Steel chooses breakneck speed over character development, and there are times when everyone in the room will be looking at each other to see if anyone is following what's happening."
"This is not a missed opportunity which rightfully elicits a sigh, but inert big-budget spectacle that is nigh deserving of contempt."
"A movie about the clash of gods should feel more epic, more awestruck, less in a hurry to get to the next uninspired plot point."
"The plot's sci-fi gobbledygook gets awfully unwieldy, and I wish the colors had popped instead of settling for such dreary realism. But this is a movie with a big heart, just like its hero."
"Clark's multiple father-and-son tales are beautifully realized and it's a very fun movie to watch. However, the romance is shallow."
"...while it doesn't achieve the brilliance of the modern Batman franchise, and while it certainly has a few flaws... the action is undeniably well-done and there are still good character bits throughout."
"A robotic exercise in moviemaking that will no doubt satisfy the requirements of millions of distracted moviegoers who no longer require absolute engagement to be entertained-and who might, in fact, prefer exactly that."
"A gritty, realistic story shot by a director whose instincts constantly push him away from grit and realism, and into flash and fantasy."
"Despite its excessive running time, and slightly meandering narrative, Man of Steel has definitely earned its place amongst recent comic-book adaptations, standing tall in the DC / Marvel cinematic universe."
"Christliness has always been an element of the Superman myth. But this film's near literal insistence upon it becomes absurd since director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer don't dramatize the analogy, they presume it."
"Like the man with a hammer to whom every problem looks like a nail, to Nolan and Goyer, every superhero universe apparently looks like Gotham City."
"Action-packed, briskly-paced and featuring a stellar cast, Man of Steel is the best Superman film since the 1978 original and proves DC can match Marvel in the massive scale department."
"Action scenes shouldn't be dull, especially large-scale ones devastating half of a city, but that's exactly what threatens to happen here."
[Zach] Snyder who made his mark with the film 300 can manipulate images but fails to bring them to life.
"A definite step-up from the last attempt to revive this character, but there's something still missing from this origin story. Other franchise builders have done more with less, but here that isn't for lack of trying."
Zack Snyder's Man of Steel is a gritty and realistic take on one of the most iconic superheroes ever. It's visually astonishing and action-packed.
MAN OF STEEL is everything you've ever wanted in a Superman movie
Action-filled but less than super: yet another summer blockbuster
"No fun costume change in a phone booth, no wowing humans with his powers and no repartee with reporter Lois Lane."
"A solid film, but a solid Superman?"
"Snyder delivers the type of undeniable, overwhelming charge with which he's become Sny-nonymous, and his affinity for spectacle strongly courses throughout."
"The screenplay by David S. Goyer is like an arm wrestling match between brain and muscle, and when one takes charge the other falls out of line."
"Uma boa releitura do personagem. Se era necessária, porém, é outra história."
The worst Superman movie since 1987's Superman IV: The Quest for Peace...
"Man Of Steel plunges headfirst into a loud, breathless science-fiction slugfest, offering much spectacle but little wonder."
"Super-duper-overStatement. A cataclysm-caravan of speeches, doomed and desolate landscapes, proclamations of glorious destiny or rebirth, and sprawling, stone-faced seriousness. Can't save itself from self-suffocating grandiosity."
"For two-thirds of the running time, the film is grandly entertaining.... But then, as we get into the climactic battles, the level of wanton destruction becomes excessive, even tacky."
"The battles between Superman and the evil Kryptonians set a new standard for on-screen urban destruction, but they also give us pause: Aren't hundreds, even thousands being killed in the riveting, spectacular smashing of skyscraper after skyscraper?"
"Man Of Steel suffers most in its final hour where in degenerates into a seen-it-all-before, CGI-laden action fest."
Man of Steel indirectly tackles the conundrum of how a mankind engrained in monolithic religion greets the concrete proof of a mythological figure. Is it possible for an alien from Krypton to reside alongside an unquestioning faith in Christ?
"The movie consists of endless declamation, endless violence."
"Superman's grand, mythic nature is both his greatest strength as a character and his fatal weakness. Man of Steel can't quite overcome this, but it's a heck of a lot of fun watching it try."
"While it gives you your fix, it doesn't put Superman back on top of our cinematic superheroes."
"Although the CGI takes over far too many times, the personality and inner torment of the 'Man of Steel' win out over the special effects."
"Though fans might miss the levity that made Richard Donner's classic 1978 film Superman: The Movie such a game-changing joy, the thing that really sells this respectful reboot is the dramatic conviction underlying all the mega-scale mayhem."
"With a gray and gritty palette and interesting structure, offers its share of thrills but may be too somber overall to appease the typical summer blockbuster fan."
"In many ways, this is the strongest Superman reboot for a long time. Yet the story manages to be both rushed and overlong, and Snyder doesn't know when to say stop."
"It'll be controversial, but to hell with it: Michael Shannon is a better General Zod than Terrence Stamp. There. I said it."
"For all its ambition, Man Of Steel fails to soar, instead crashlanding in a humourless, melodramatic mess of explosions."
A mostly-entertaining dark science-fiction parable about morality.
A superhero boom crash opera
"Snyder largely succeeds in creating an epic piece of blockbuster filmmaking that still understands the value of smaller, intimate moments."
"Man of Steel fails to get off the ground, with Snyder's overblown display of style smothering the many interesting moments that delve into the man behind the red cape."
Parental drama is Man of Steel's most potent weapon. For all of the film's issues - and they will be discussed - it resonated on a deeply emotional level. That alone helps it to stand tall above the pack.
The film is about finding your inner child and acceptance and maturing into something greater. This is what gives me hope for the inevitable sequel.
"The problem with Man of Steel is that while the background story and character development are solid, the action sequences are distressingly generic and bland."
"An unceasing torrent of CGI explosions, destruction and superhuman Kryptonian combat, Man of Steel is more bang for your summer movie buck, but would there was magic and spark to go along with all that muscle."
"Rise of the Beasts is the best Transformers entry since Bumblebee, but it won’t be the last time we see these robots fight on the big screen."
"As a review, I'll give it a C+ for delivering what you'd expect. As a note, make sure to stick around for the end credit scene."
... The movie continues the current tendency of delivering a good time to the audience at the movies with a sci-fi super production that doesn't forget to also offer relatable characters. [Full review in Spanish]
"It plays it safe, and while that does make it watchable it doesn’t make it good."
Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts is all about the heart that the story infuses into this plot about robots fighting other robots.
"Rise of The Beasts plays it safe when compared to the Bay-era, and falls short of the previous iteration Bumblebee. The movie is still funny and charming, with just enough action, and a good amount of heart."
"What an annoyance to have a 'Transformers' movie with well-drawn humans, only to have them choke on the exhaust fumes of franchise expectations."
A movie heavy on action and light on story and acting.
"Bay, at least, wasn't afraid to take chances. Rise of the Beasts, unfortunately, feels as though it's trying way too hard to color in the lines. "
"The seventh installment to the beloved Hasbro Toys franchise redials the overall narrative and visuals into pure nostalgia escapism that sets the Transformers back on track.

"
. . .A mixed bag that establishes this latest outing as less than meets the eye.
"It's all just such a wasted opportunity and a rather inconspicuous start to the heaven help us, ""Hasbro Cinematic Autoverse"", even if it's still easily the second best of the modern Transformers movies."
As dull as a smashed headlight.
"This movie is, of course, very loud, lots of special effects, but it does have a good story at it's heart, partly because Anthony Ramos & Dominique Fishback really center this film and give it a real emotional heft. "
Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts is a film that will be enjoyed by hardcore Transformers films and because of the re-boot vibe is easily accessible to those who haven’t seen the other films.
"Transformers Rise of the Beasts is the equivalent of looking back at your childhood when you would grab your action figures! 

 Fun, Amusing, & enjoyable BUT that's it The 3rd act’s Action set piece is up there with Bumblebee’s Opening Scene though! "
"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is one of the franchise’s best yet. If you’re a fan of great action, special effects and hip-hop culture with a great story, this movie is one to watch."
"After Michael Bay tarnished the essence of the Autobot spirit with his soul-draining movies, Steven Caple Jr. returns some pride to the Hasbro warriors. He does that by keeping the focus on the robots, and not the humans. "
"Everything about the film is half-assed – the writing, performances and staging of action sequences are executed with a shrug. "
"If you’ve been down the path several times before, you’ll realize they never really did figure out the Transformers’ purpose.

Sometimes a cool toy is just that."
some new characters (human and robot) ... liven up things enough for the first half. Yet it ultimately devolves into a big smashing robot movie that’s so-so
I don't know why they thought this was it. But this ain't it.
I don't like films produced or directed by Michael Bay. This film is no exception.
"Without Bay at the helm, the ear-screeching carnage is taken down a decibel or two. With Steven Caple Jr. (Creed II) directing, this latest battle between alien robots, clocking in at around two hours, is ever so slightly more bearable."
Has enough action for several movies and a load of heart to keep the story relevant.
Caple simply lacks the cocky bravado and 'roided-up visual panache that Bay brought to the table.
"Rise of the Beasts provides all the car chases, shootouts, and metal-on-metal mayhem you could hope for in a Transformers movie.
"
"Indiana Jones meets Transformers!  a successful, family-friendly mix of high-spirited adventure and humor."
"Exists at the level of narrative sophistication of children idly mashing their toys together whilst making ""pow, screech, aiieeeeeee"" noises, which is sincerely better than any of the earlier movies were able to achieve."
"A [...] wholesome, Saturday morning popcorn flick that is incredibly digestible, but ultimately forgettable as it glides through an easy 127 minutes with heart, cheese and a sense of inoffensive fun."
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a nostalgic and entertaining 1990s thrill ride.
"Anthony Ramos is the key to maintaining a relatable story, he rocked this movie!"
"As the CGI smash-ups and solemn speeches mount, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts makes heavy going of something that ought to be a lot more fun."
A convoluted but mildly engrossing adventure.
"The great news is that director Steven Caple Jr. does such a good job maintaining the thrill-a-minute pace and the frame-filling action of the other films that it looks as though it was directed by Michael Bay. No greater praise is possible, surely."
[Director] Steven Caple Jr. [lets stars] Ramos and Fishback develop their characters and minimize the damage wrought by a uniformly awful screenplay. But doesn’t that make the inevitable downshift to robot-on-robot violence all the more joyless?
"Listen. If you're not the sort of person who's ever going to want to see a Transformers movie, that's fine. But if you are, then you might like Rise of the Beasts quite a lot."
"Much of the appeal of this movie is due to the efforts of talented and attractive actors, Dominique Fishback and Anthony Ramos. Both have a strong screen presence and plenty of emotional range for the roller coaster of events their characters go through."
"Director Steven Caple Jr serves up a perfectly respectable and often exciting tale of giant transforming robots and the humans who love them, but the gleefully demented approach of previous franchise director Michael Bay is sometimes sorely missed"
"Like Bumblebee, Rise of the Beast is a jolt of good old blockbuster fun that recharges the Transformers franchise. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"With uneven pacing, a runtime longer than it could’ve been, and not enough good performances from the cast, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts manages to erase the good faith Bumblebee brought to the franchise."
"The dialogue and comedic punch lines feel so paint-by-numbers, you’d be hard-pressed to laugh when the music dies down just enough for them to stick the line. "
"Steven Caple Jr. is a very capable director, but he appears lost on how to make anything fresh for this increasingly convoluted action series."
"Director Steven Caple Jr. interweaves genial humans and sentient machines into a coherent, spectacle-laden,  CGI-based story, credited to five screenwriters."
Just a bunch of robots (in disguise) smacking into each other and insulting each other's pants (second part of quote untrue; I made it up). 
An average action/sci-fi blockbuster that progresses passively through its action and visual effects showcases.
"If you can get on its wavelength as a film at odds with itself, Rise of the Beasts is an enjoyable summer blockbuster that plays the narrative hits, good guys and bad guys in a race for a MacGuffin, and supplies the requisite action sequence."
The first 30 minutes and final 30 minutes are fun enough but Rise of the Beasts is yet another big budget movie that gets lost in its own mythology for seemingly no reason. 
"Transformers Rise of the Beasts is full of unfinished ideas that would've made for a way better Transformers movie. The designs are excellent and the action sequences are fun, but the undercooked story and the Maximals leads to a good, but not great film."
"It is just a classic summer popcorn flick, but on the curve of Transformers movies, that makes it one of the better ones."
The action was easy to follow. The character development was good... it wasn't like Michael Bay mayhem. We got time to breathe. We got time to take it in.
"What you have here in Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is the worst of all possible IP worlds: a lifeless imitation of its predecessors that’s as annoying as it is dull, meant only to lead into an inevitable “shared universe” at some point."
"Without either Michael Bay’s maximalist flair or Bumblebee’s tenderness, Rise of the Beasts manages to be one of the lesser entries of a saga with an already low bar to clear. "
"Rise of The Beasts sits comfortably in the middle of the two Transformers extremes: not as charming as Bumblebee, but far from the messy fairground antics of the Bay films. Mindless but fun in places, fans will be well-served. "
"Ultimately, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a formulaic (except for the lack of romance, which is a nice change) action film featuring an angstier Optimus Prime and yet another seemingly indestructible Transformers supervillain."
"Rise of the Beasts tones down the Bay explosions for a more grounded experience about extraterrestrial robots trying to get back home and while the Transformers themselves are absolutely delightful, the humans, per usual, fall flat. "
Actually quite enjoyable... a worthy entry in this Transformers franchise.
A fun Sunday matinee that kept my inner twelve year old happy.
"It has all the things that a Transformers film needs... I'm not a big fan of the franchise, but I was entertained for the most part. "
"Both the performances and voice performances work well enough to make us like the characters despite the frequent lazy writing. Though it falls short of the heart shown in Bumblebee, it's an enjoyable if not wholly satisfying experience. "
"Caple has crafted an energetic and charming adventure film, devoid of the cheap laughs that Bay glorified and instead going for genuinely funny jokes that aren’t at anyone’s expense, with a likable, capable cast that feels like real people."
"If you had hoped for either more of Bumblebee‘s tone, or a proper rise of Maximals, you will find yourself a bit disappointed."
"It won't convince the skeptics, but at least it won't leave them with a severe headache, like the Michael Bay movies. It will entertain them, but they will forget about it in a couple of days. Full review in Spanish."
"While the plot is both simple and absurd, it's underscored by genial wit. Director Steven Caple Jr skilfully resists letting robot-vs-robot action take over. And the brisk pace mixed with knowing gags makes for a thrilling romp."
I get fatigued. 
The Michael Bay films were garbage but at least had his elevated subpar vision of action sequences. This new one shows next to no personality and becomes just more metal-on-metal fighting in search of an Endgame battlefield we don't care about.
"If there are any merits to this franchise movie, it would be that it has better character development than past entries. [Full review in Spanish]"
The best thing about the Transformers franchise has always been the sound the Autobots make as they transform... although I’m still unsure why they would want to be disguised as a Volkswagen Beetle.
At least Peter Cullen is still getting plenty of work.
Rise of the Beasts suffers from the story cornering itself without much room to expand. 
"There is enough good entertainment here to make it a perfect summer matinee movie, especially for younger audiences. "
"This is what a Transformers movie should be, with a tight narrative, clean action sequences and heart whether human or robotic."
"Transformers:Rise of the Beasts is a soft reboot that has the spark to reinvigorate the franchise. Steven Caple Jr. does a rather impressive job at showing us a world closer to the source material in both story and spirit, that feels both new and familiar"
"In all fairness, I think I might have enjoyed this film if I was nine years old."
Certainly delivers on needless destruction and world-class stupidity.
"We may lose regard for the gravitas of the film’s premise, and we may know exactly where the film is headed. But it doesn’t keep “Rise of the Beasts” from rising above and delivering a clean, fun, monster-romping good time."
"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts isn’t worth rolling out to the theatre for. 
"
"[Transformers: Rise of the Beasts] relies too much on the audience’s enjoyment of Pete Davidson’s Mirage, who never forms a connection with Ramos’s Noah in the way the script needs to establish the emotional relationship it leads up to."
"The Bay versions of these films settled for fear or awe at these engines of destruction; now that’s not on the table anymore the filmmakers are at last trying to get something more developed out of it, but it may be too little, too late."
"It’s not spectacular enough to impress us, nor intimate enough to move us. It’s just kind of there — ready to be consumed and forgotten."
Does for toy robots what the 'SpiderVerse' franchise did for Marvel superheroes.
"While the battle sequences could use more style, they are solid, and this entry feels tonally consistent throughout. The two human leads are good, but the Autobots and Maximals shine."
There’s not a morsel of joy to be found in the franchise’s latest ludicrous outing.
"Even with its abundance of action, the franchise’s newest addition boasts little life or heart compared with its predecessors."
"Beasts encourages you to let your eyes glaze over through the plot exposition and embrace the visceral nonsense. Beasts is dumber than a box of hammers, but it doesn’t drip with the rote cynicism of, say, Fast X. "
Dominique Fishback totally outclasses her infantile dialogue...
"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts won't reinvent the wheel, but its sci-fi action thrills prove that good live-action Transformers sequels are doable."
"More coherent than the garbage from Michael Bay, but still a noisy, overblown mess."
Transformers is sure to achieve its key role of entertaining your kids. How much is down to computers or the human touch perhaps doesn’t matter that much.
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts can be boiled down to another film about alien robots fighting over the earth while humanity can only watch in horror as they wreck havoc across the planet.
The movie doesn’t have much going for it.
Rise of the Beasts is seen as a bit more moderate and enjoyable than the Michael Bay movies. [Full review in Spanish] 
The only thing wrong with Transformers: Rise of the Beast is that it’s bland and boring.
"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is arguably the best film with the word “Transformers” in the title and frees the series from its robotic shell, but that’s not saying a heck of a lot."
"In terms of personality, the Transformers still only come in two varieties: annoying and [404 error: character traits not found]. "
The latest installment rises above most in the franchise by scaling back. 
"This is a movie that people can definitely enjoy; with some cool action, crazy effects and solid music. It's entertaining the same way Fast X is. That doesn't mean they are good movies."
"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a movie for people who love Transformers and Maximals and don’t care about story, characterization, logic, or anything else that typically constitutes a quality motion picture."
This hunk-of-junk piece of IP commodification truly can’t be regarded with any further value other than that: a transactional piece of content. 
"While not as outright fun as Bumblebee...Rise of the Beasts is still an entertaining thrill ride adventure, capturing the spirit of what it means to be a summer blockbuster."
"Snyder’s weakest DCEU film was by far Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, an overwrought attempt to shoehorn Ben Affleck’s Batman into the Superman story Snyder started with Man of Steel.

"
"I had no problem following the story, understanding the motivations, or investing in the characters. I love that these heroes aren’t copy and pasted from past films. I had no problems with it being dark, serious, and humorless. "
"I want to see a great film about Batman fighting Superman, and I want to see a great film about the Justice League. Regrettably, this scattered, ambitious effort sets out to achieve too much and doesn't accomplish enough."
"Sometimes it sins with its expository dialogues, some themes are halfway to develop, it can be a little slow... but none of these failures transform it into the misfortune that the critics have been commissioned to sell [Full review in Spanish]"
"The leads embody their characters despite creative shortcomings, and could hold up a strong Justice League if the franchise is given some new directorial talent..."
Maybe the film industry is tapping into our culture's difficulty with intelligent and mature conflict resolution...
Unsatisfyingly curious.
"Batman v Superman is almost unrelentingly dark, making the two-and-a-half hour movie tougher to get through than the lighter-toned Marvel movies. But it earns its superhero stripes thanks to great performances and some truly knockout action scenes."
"At 2 hours and 33 minutes in length, the plot has some clear pacing issues. Too many ideas, whilst not enough happening."
"Anticipated for decades, the grand punch-up between Superman, last son of Krypton, and Batman, lost son of Gotham, arrives not with great fanfare but with a big raspberry."
"Altogether this is not a great film. It would not be incorrect to consider it a poor one. It is a poor film, however, with outstanding pieces in it."
"Action-packed and epic, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice delivers an unmissable fight between its title characters, and successfully deepens the mythology of the DC Universe as only Zack Snyder can."
"Let's not make any bones about it - on any scale, Dawn of Justice is painful to watch."
"There was a time when superhero movies were fun, escapist entertainment. But now our caped and cowled heroes are as dark and troubled as a reject from a Kafka novel which, in this case, makes for a rather loud but dreary night at the movies."
It would be nice if there was a moment of dialogue that allowed us to care about the heroes we look up to on the big screen.
It's bad enough that a single movie isn't big enough for both Batman and Superman; it's even worse that they must share the screen with Wonder Woman and several new villains.
Cinematography and editing were good. The CGI effects were not overly-done or poorly-executed and that was all this movie needed to be as entertaining and exciting as it was.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is kind of wonderful in a steampunk meets industrial punk sort of way.
The ultimate edition is a superior version to the theatrical cut and certainly has restored my faith in the franchise.
"This was a violent, miserable experience that only got worse the further it went."
"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice wants so badly to be an operatic modern mythological tale, but it mistakes great length for epic stature."
"Just like Man of Steel, there are some good things within this over-bloated monstrosity of a movie, but they can't come together to equal a great movie."
"If I had known that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a trailer over two and a half hours long, I would save myself the trip to the movies by repeating the three minute trailer on YouTube. [Full review in Spanish]"
It wasn't good.
"This movie was awful... It was so confusing, it was so boring, it was so long."
"In closing, BvS is a big, bold experiment made by people who really care."
Batman and Superman are supposed to be two very different characters... [But] this isn't Batman v Superman. It's Batman v Batman.
"While Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice is congested in its first two acts, it compels through masterful action sequences and a brilliant new take on the Caped Crusader."
"Exceedingly uneven, alternately exasperating and exhilarating, confounding and compelling."
It's great fantasy entertainment.
Keep your expectations well in check and you might find yourself enjoying this.
"...it doesn't stick the landing, but no tentpole blockbuster has ever flown so close to the sun while obscuring that light under layers and layers of gray."
"Some diehard DC comic fans will try to do mental gymnastics to describe the crap biscuit they were just force-fed as delicious. They shouldn't. They should demand better. And ""better"" than this shouldn't be hard."
"Don't bother with this one. The acting is sub par & the CGI is hard to look at. Superman was the only saving grace but still not worth watching, unless you need help sleeping."
"Wondering how to teach your offspring that the world is a horrifying, random, awful place? Let director Zack Snyder take care of that for you."
Lex Luthor's plan has so many plot holes as well as the script as a whole.
"Dawn of Justice is perhaps not the Batman/Superman film we deserve, but it's the one we have right now. This chapter has just enough spark to light the universe fuse."
Zack Snyder has directed both films and has successfully delivered a rich and cohesive cinematic world in which to set his growing cast of superheroes and villains.
Batman v Superman is a great film and a spectacle that marks a new era for superheroes. [Full Review in Spanish]
"One big, beautiful mess. This film is screaming with so much potential but, for the most part, it fails to capture that potential at every single turn."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is dark and dour through and through.
"Director Zack Snyder and four screenwriters, including David S. Goyer, opt for a darker tone than audiences are accustomed to in Superman films. This time it works, however, with the inclusion of Batman giving it a grittier edge."
There's a whole subplot (...) about the world trying to decide how it feels about Superman (...) and it's so important that it's dropped about an hour into the movie.
...akin to a Philosophy 101 thesis read aloud while you're being punched repeatedly in the face.
Snyder debe entender que algo oscuro no es precisamente realista.
"Where BvS largely succeeds as a visual feast of imagery and action spectacle, it fails in creating an emotional backdrop for its gods to resonate with us mortals."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice suffers from being both highly derivative and uninspired at the same time
"Snyder's Superman is the most universally relatable version of the character yet and the social, political and cultural significance of BvS will be appreciated over time"
BVS's most pivotal scene centers around a jar of urine. I'm not kidding.
"""There's very little room to breathe in Synder's world, one that appears permanently stained with an oppressively ashen color palette."""
"Snyder's big-budgeted connect-the-dots comic book caper feel so incoherently stiff and aimless. Humorless and hackneyed, Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice will probably satisfy indiscriminate devoted fans that will buy into the proposed heralded rivalry"
A mega-budgeted mess of a movie that betrays all the telltale signs of a studio at war with itself.
Zack Snyder ends decades of anticipation and finally brings both Batman and Superman together for the first time on the big screen with Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice.
"[An] ungainly, dreary, feature-length trailer for the DC Cinematic Universe that confuses quantity with quality and volume for depth."
"It's difficult to not feel like a lot of ""Batman v Superman"" is an exhaustive - and expensive- effort from DC and Warner Bros. to catch up to Disney and Marvel's well-oiled cinematic universe."
"As a comic book fan myself, ""Batman v Superman"" has its moments, but is underwhelming as a film and lacks any fully realized characters."
An incoherent mess with unnecessary prolonged sequences that just extends the time limit
"BvS strains so hard for relevance that it forgets superheroes are to the adult world what Buffy was to high school: a series of choices and difficult events, elevated to a mythic level of high stakes."
"The result of its prolonged and ridiculous premise, over-use of CGI and explosions and lack of any interesting characters? Boredom."
"Say what you will about this cluttered, densely plotted do gooder yarn; it sure doesn't play like escapism."
"If you like Batman v. Superman already, then you'll definitely enjoy the ultimate cut."
A pretty hollow movie that wants to be more than just a superhero movie and showcase its characters because they are the most popular comic book characters of all time.
"The results are shocking, at times borderline sadistic but effective. Like the musical score, which resembles a chorus of anvils, Batman v Superman pummels the audience into submission."
"WHen this movie is good, it is really, really good...but man, when it is not? Brace yourself. This movie suffers from fighting with itself for screen time."
"It wants us to believe it's trafficking in topical notions of politics, religion, and moral ambiguity, but its main currency is our contemporary penchant for hip and affected pessimism."
"Zack Snyder doubles down on the killing and the brooding in Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, a sequel to 2013's polarizing Man of Steel, and a disappointing film from start to finish."
"It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it was pretty bad."
"The movie is a colossal letdown on almost every front, but in some ways, it was to be expected considering the magnitude of what DC and Warner Bros. wanted to accomplish only two films into their shared universe"
"Zack Snyder is not a subtle director. An understatement, I know. But it's more obvious than ever here."
"As the pair pound away at each other, it's the hapless viewer who's left begging for mercy, battered into submission by Snyder's overbearing direction and Hans Zimmer's bombastic score."
"By the time Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice concludes, don't be surprised if you're cranky and exhausted from its hectic, tumultuous conclusion."
"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is recommended only so you can end the almost three-year long wait to find out what happens in the epic collision, but unfortunately for nothing more than that."
"It flits to and fro between them, often at dizzying speed, in a way that for a long time is quite enjoyable and yet always carried the danger that my head might explode. Batman... Superman... Batman... Superman... Lex Luthor!"
Batman v Superman is not the franchise jump-starter anyone wanted. It's poison in the Justice League well.
"Go for the Affleck, stay for the Gadot."
"It's exactly what you're expecting, but longer, louder, and with an almost unfathomable amount of digitally created violence."
"At two-and-a-half hours, the film features Wayne and Kent mostly glowering at each other at swanky high-rise parties as the rabble teems below."
"It is without question an important film today, and a quintessential product of the America we inhabit."
"Ultimately, Batman v. Superman is a film with no real reason for being, other than to usher in the next round of DC Universe films, and to provide a bunch of explosions."
"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is such a bleak, disorienting and incoherent mess that despite the few promising moments that sporadically appear, it's nearly impossible to enjoy."
"There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time."
"Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice is not so much a movie as it is an extended warning: You comic book movie fans better like this, because there's going to be a hell of a lot more where this came from."
The script BvS is guaranteed to make people stop complaining about the sloppiness of the third act of Spectre.
"Snyder knows how to paint a picture but perhaps needs to stay away from the writing process. Watch the Ultimate Edition when you can, and see if it changes how you feel about the movie. It sure did me."
It seems amazing that something as idiotic as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice could now even get beyond the pitching stage.
This film isn't as bad as the initial backlash would imply but nor is it anywhere near as good as its own hype promised.
"Remember when comic book movies were fun? Well, you'll have to use your memory because there's not much fun to be found in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."
"By the end of the film's near-unwatchable final battle, any hope of nuance or intentional subtext had been snuffed out by hours of ugly CGI and pulverized debris."
The movie is too long. Too much story contains too little humanity or drama. Too many things happen far too often for the really big things to register with an audience when they're filing out of the theater.
"For all the film's noise, and thrumming violence, it's pretty hard to care very much about either principal hero."
"As this uneven film grinds to an end, it sets itself up for more shenanigans in more episodes with more super heroes."
"Snyder has brought a different edge to the superhero genre, one that questions what drives these men of steel and creatures of the night to do what they do and believe what they believe. There is something to admire in that."
"While not the worst superhero comic book adventure ever to grace the multiplex, it's likely the most frustratingly disappointing."
"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice pits the two titans against each other with beautiful visuals, too many characters, and a borderline nonsensical plot."
The smartest thing about Zach Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) is its revisionist take on the destruction that concluded his Superman reboot Man of Steel.
"The superhero world needed better storytelling, a comic touch and more than a few rays of sunshine. The story is crippled by special effects from start to finish."
"Wildly overstuffed and oddly slapdash, filled with characters and sequences that serve little purpose other than to set up a 'cinematic universe.'"
"It wants to be a lot of things, and it keeps on falling short; but it's not afraid to go Very Big in its attempts to return to the idea of superheroes as modern mythology."
"I wish I could tell you more, but honestly it's all just a blur of pretentious speeches about what lurks in the hearts of men and noisy fight scenes and nonsensical dream sequences."
"Snyder's gone all drab and dire, determined to lay siege to our senses (and plot). There's so much glowering, gloominess and good-ness talk that it's hard to imagine the sun, or justice, ever dawning for this disastrous cavalcade of dreary characters."
"A rom-com about how relationships tend to end up, rather than the more idealized version of Meg Ryan’s classic films."
A mild rom-com. It did not entirely work for me... I did not feel the chemistry between David Duchovny and Meg Ryan. 
That Meg Ryan comeback. Let's pretend it didn't happen.
"This isn’t a great movie by any stretch, but it’s nice to see Ryan back doing her thing while also showing us she’s matured as an actor in ways I wasn’t certain she would."
"Another unfair break for Ryan, as I imagine a less interesting version of this movie would have been more warmly received."
"Despite its flaws, it’s easy to be charmed by the unconventional flair of this modern love story. "
Why Duchovny and Ryan would ever unite is one of the big mysteries of this film. The two aren’t the first you think of when it comes to ticking off lists of weather events.
What Happens Later has a disarming charm that sneaks up on you.
"the behavior of the two “adults” does not make much sense as they banter, complain, criticize and emote about their past and present lives. I should care about the characters but I do not – at all."
"Ryan's fans will be thrilled to see her back on screen, but it's unlikely others will want to ""have what she's having."""
" It's hard to take much heart out of the message, here. It turns out that ""What Happens Later"" is we're all stuck, each with our own version of our past, one that doesn't allow us to learn much from it."
"The premise has wings and Ryan + Duchovny are well-matched, but just like the planes grounded on the tarmac, the movie fails to take flight."
"The cloud of dissatisfaction I felt after watching it kept trying to reshape its molecules into a better movie, albeit one that could live only in my head."
"Ryan and Duchovny deliver compelling, affecting performances despite the lackluster screenplay."
"What Happens Later is the kind of thing the studios that made Ryan’s earlier romantic comedies seem to have walked away from. Fortunately, if only this one time, she has brought it back -- older, wryer maybe, but just as smart and just as heartfelt."
"Meg Ryan returning to the big screen in the genre that launched her career made me exceptionally giddy. Though Meg and David Duchovny were clearly having a good time, the overall story could have been a bit more memorable. "
"While Ryan and Duchovny have good chemistry and bring emotional truth to Willa and Bill, the situation that allows for this to happen never ceases to feel artificial and forced. [Full review in Spanish]"
The key is understanding that nobody makes it to that age without handling as much baggage as an airport. That’s what makes Ms. Ryan’s second directorial effort a surprising treat.
The chemistry between Duchovny and Ryan takes flight long before the planes are ready to board. 
Duchovny and Ryan have nice chemistry and there are some sweet moments as they unravel their past
Life and love have a different taste when there are more years behind than ahead.
"Despite some laughs along the way, it drags more than it delights."
"If listening to Ryan and co-star David Duchovney chit-chat for two hours is your idea of a good time, go for it. Others, beware. It is, as the Brits say, “A bit twee.”"
"In an attempt to revive the rom-com, Meg Ryan takes us to the most unfunny and unromantic place imaginable, a regional airport."
"What Happens Later has such a chip on its shoulder about its relationship to its own maligned genre that it never actually gets around to much by way of pleasure, which you might argue is that genre’s main purpose."
"Ryan’s return to the romcom might remind us of her rare skillset within the genre but it also makes us crave more, the answer to What Happens Later being ultimately: not that much."
"“What Happens Later” doesn't reach the heights of Ryan’s beloved romantic comedies, but its sweet comforts might be just the ticket if you’re looking for laughter-through-tears on the couch on a Sunday afternoon."
"What’s missing in “What Happens Later” is outright startling: whimsy. Or maybe it’s heart — or both? Basically, there’s something vacant behind the metaphoric eyes of the film, because there’s nothing going on beneath the surface."
Seeing Meg Ryan in a romantic comedy is a treat to us all. 
"Though not her best romantic comedy, there is still much to love about Meg Ryan's latest."
"It’s a delight to welcome Meg Ryan back to the silver screen after an extended hiatus, and in the genre she helped rejuvenate. Innovatively eschewing genre tropes, she favors authentic character drive — with just a little twee magic sprinkled in."
"Drab, grayscale shots of a man and woman sitting at the gate are not my idea of a good time, especially when underscored by David Boman’s sappy Hallmark movie music."
"What Happens Later has a wily charm about it in the way that it just keeps pushing — pushing to be noticed, pushing to be obvious, pushing to be loved. If it doesn't all the way work, it's a commendable effort and a reminder of Ryan's considerable charms."
"Those in search of the soothingly feel-good vibes offered by Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron would be wise to look elsewhere, as Ryan has instead crafted what basically amounts to Before Sunset for the AARP crowd... [but without any] emotional honesty."
"Had the film focused on the heart of the drama and let these two characters engage with their messy history together, this could have been flying high. Unfortunately, what we get stays flat on the ground."
Subverts the expectations of what one would expect of Will and Wilehmina’s meet-cute reunion as the artifice of its set-up starts to fall away and the two can get real with one another about where they are in their lives.
"Ryan and Duchovny both have the charm, mileage in life, and acting chops to adeptly shift from comedy to drama on a dime, which makes What Happens Later work very well."
"A film like this doesn’t need to do anything new as long as you have two leads that can sell the material, and Ryan and Duchovny do just that. "
"“What Happens Later” is so deeply heartfelt and so beautifully performed that it stirs something within — a hope, not necessarily for an airport rendezvous but for a moment of healing, the kind that everyone desires and everyone deserves.

"
"Meg Ryan and David Duchovny are ready for a better, more rewarding film than What Happens Later."
What Happens Later makes us feel stuck in this story that doesn't have much to say or do and takes a long time to get there.
"While it’s unlikely to join the rom-com pantheon, its charming leads and humorous truths do invoke the spirit of Ephron, to whom the film is dedicated."
"What Happens Later is so overwritten and cumbersome that it feels like you are there for every minute of that overnight delay rather than a 103-minute movie 
"
"Isn’t big on tingles, but it does have Ryan and co-star David Duchovny, who share decent chemistry in this tale of regret, helping to bring an otherwise static but deeply felt picture to life."
"""What Happens Later"" does give off the feel of an Ephron film, and that's meant as a compliment since laughter, reflection, compassion and even understanding and misunderstandings."
"A romantic comedy that tries to be funny, whimsical, and deep, but ends up being none of those things."
"What Happens Later isn't without some hiccups in its execution, but with Meg Ryan back at the helm, it's impossible not to feel charmed.

"
"For all of its build-up, the movie ultimately deflates with a disappointing squeal, like a half-blown-up balloon that someone abandoned because finishing the process felt like too much work."
"“What Happens Later” is no rom-com, but it’s a surprisingly moving chapter in Ryan’s screen story; a gentle reminder that we carry our pasts with us — and that sometimes, we get a second chance to make things right."
" A sparkling romantic comedy. Meg Ryan and David Duchovny are magic together. Enchanting, witty and delightful. It's a warm, funny and tender journey well worth taking. See it with someone you love."
"This might have worked as a short film or a 30-minute TV episode, but as a feature film, it grows increasingly cloying as the minutes tick on."
A young audience may not fully appreciate the existential quandary the two principals face here. But those with a little more life under their belts will likely feel differently.
"What might have proved effective theatrically comes across as wholly artificial and schematic onscreen, despite Ryan’s considerable efforts as both director and performer."
"Maybe somebody somewhere has made a better American film about mature love, but at this moment, I can’t think of any."
"While recapturing the vibe of her '90s oeuvre, the film advances the formula for people who have grown up since then."
"Not having seen Steven Dietz’s play ‘Shooting Star,’ it is difficult to determine what cowriter (with Dietz and Kirk Lynn)/director Meg Ryan saw in his airport romance, but what she’s done with it is something best left on the tarmac.  "
Farrier's gutsy exploration and ability to dredge the most bizarre happenings to the surface put Louis Theroux to shame.
The enthralling mystery at the heart of Mister Organ is the way Farrier establishes that there is nothing there to Organ—he calls him a “black hole” at one point—while being unable to stop himself from getting caught up in the man’s grievances.
Mister Organ is the kind of documentary one needs to experience along with Farrier. When Farrier isn’t feeling as threatened as he should a new piece of information pops up to expand on Organ’s grip over people and the numerous ways he has ruined lives
An unhinged character study. 
"It feels taxing in some way to even watch the movie—like, great, now I need to go through life knowing he exists. What can I do to avoid him?"
"This is someone who sucks the life out of you, but it makes for a hell of an interesting documentary. Mister Organ is fantastic."
"David Farrier’s latest documentary Mister Organ is perhaps scarier than any horror movie as it paints a portrait of a real-life narcissist.

"
It’s a gripping yarn fuelled by larger than life figures and twists upon twists without making light of serious material.
"Another New Zealand-based exploration of weird behavior, although this time it’s centered around the behavior of a specific guy."
 It's less an examination of the psyche of one man than a PSA about manipulators.
Mister Organ is a chilling work that will have viewers cautiously looking over their shoulders and screening their phone calls after leaving the theatre.
"At the risk of his sanity, Farrier has bottled one of the darkest ways a law-abiding human can be made."
"Farrier doesn’t offer a tidy conclusion or many answers; however, his film is irresistible and gripping. It’s also a warning. "
"Mister Organ is unhinged chaos; Michael Organ is a black hole, and David Farrier has fallen into it."
Farrier eloquently captures and transports the audience into the state of infuriation and mania he must've felt during filming. Organ is a psychological terror who weaves an entrancing spell. A riveting and disturbing watch.
It's the kind of story that might need a trigger warning for viewers who have fallen victim to manipulators like Organ. And it's a journey that can't help but draw you into its web of deceit—coercive and fatigued alike.
"It’s a long, hard ninety minutes, even with someone as charming as Farrier leading the charge, but that ultimately feels like the point — that minutes turn to hours with Michael Organ."
"Mister Organ is the kind of documentary that makes you sit there with your mouth agape, stunned by what you’re witnessing."
"Farrier may regret this experience, but regardless, it's compelling..."
"If its title, “Mister Organ,” initially strikes you as humorous, you won’t be laughing long."
"Farrier’s frustrations spill off the screen and give the viewer the same anxiety the reporter feels, the same anxiety anyone shares who knows something about facing down a lying, harassing, bullying moron who won’t leave you be."
"Mister Organ is a portrait of Michael Organ, a man who has been wreaking havoc throughout the “Beverly Hills of Auckland.” It’s David’s own pride that keeps him here long after the audience wishes he would put away the camera."
"Entertaining in the way the true crime documentary genre has blossomed, addictively, in the past decade or two. But it also captures the exhausting and petty banality of its main subject. "
"Mister Organ is a tangled web of deceit, devious dealing, and death. In many ways, it's a document of a tragedy in progress and a warning beacon to everyone in all of New Zealand to avoid it's subject at all costs. "
"Like Farrier’s previous documentary Tickled, Mister Organ takes viewers down one garden path before veering sharply down a darker, far more twisty road — a chilling, personal account of a man who sinks his claws into you and refuses to let go. "
"Somehow, Farrier continually finds himself involved in the strangest stories imaginable. Much of Mister Organ feels like he's reckoning with his own poor decision-making."
"Part of what makes Mister Organ such a rich text is that it isn’t just a portrait of a strange man. It’s also a portrait of the documentarian, a film about its own filming... [it's] funny and strange, thrilling and sad."
"As much as the credits roll before all of the answers are forthcoming, Farrier is able to engender interest in this character, and in how his personal story began to overlap with his subject’s. "
"Mister Organ is an early contender for the most jaw-dropping and entertaining doc of the year, moving briskly and never outstaying its welcome."
"Ultimately, Mister Organ is a fascinating – and hilarious – look at one man’s rampant narcissism and how it affects those he comes into contact with. "
"If you haven’t knowingly observed a narcissist before, this may well make for fascinating and, indeed, cautionary viewing."
"Although [Farrier's] latest film doesn’t have the same degree of shocking twists and turns as [Tickled], viewers will nevertheless find a fiendish stranger-than-fiction story about a central figure who’s more urban legend than man."
"David Farrier’s documentary feature is a study in sociopathy, as the filmmaker and his gaslighting subject play mind games"
"Another disturbing, perplexing, larger-than-life yet unshakeably authentic slice of life, and another piece of proof that humanity's worst impulses will always seep out any way they can."
"Mister Organ is everything you are hoping it will be. This is a dark, compelling, bleakly hilarious and -- at times -- disturbing film."
"Once again, Farrier has somehow attracted - or been attracted to (it’s hard to tell) - another unbelievable real life character that is fascinating and mesmerising in the worst ways possible."
"It's one of the best-looking documentaries ever made in this country-cinematographer Dominic Fryer actually manages to do something new and interesting with 1:1 interviews, and certain locations take on a truly sinister quality thanks to creative framing."
"Mister Organ is a remarkable film: A comedic horror of a documentary, a simple piece of investigative journalism descending into madness, and a spotlight on the human spirit’s capacity for darkness."
"""Mister Organ” deserves attention."
"Mister Organ offers a somewhat lucid glimpse of the danger that people like him pose to the public. If only it didn’t feel like Farrier himself were standing on the outside looking in, perhaps Mister Organ could have offered more than just a glimpse."
"Mister Organ is a riveting, tense examination of when something is so fascinating that it might not be worth poking around in order to just not wake up a dangerous sleeping bear."
"By the time things end, Ferrier and the audience have been on an out of control ride that is frightening and taxing. Ferrier shows vulnerability in allowing the audience get so immersed in this work and the toll it is taking on him. "
Fascinating and highly disturbing. 
It will both shock and amuse in equal measure.  
I just can't stand this group and the ending is unbelievable
By the end of the film...I always find myself tearing up.
"The Family Stone flips the script by having Thad be loved and supported by all his siblings and both his parents. Nothing can compete with Diane Lane, as Thad’s mom..."
There is a lack of craft to the project in nearly every sense that sees great actors give good performances as bad characters.
"Although ""Stone"" has some problems, it's still a film that works -- thanks to a very agreeable cast."
"Remarkably for a Hollywood movie, this very entertaining comedy proves that the outward good cheer and inward bad vibes of the Christmas season can not only coexist, but amusingly feed upon each other."
"The movie feels sentimental but never cheesy: Our allegiances shift throughout, until we decide everyone deserves our sympathy, everyone has reasons."
a gob of yuletide Play-Doh
The Family Stone works hard to warm the cockles of our hearts. The cast is attractive. The sentiments are commendable. But the love Bezucha wants us to feel for the family couldn't possibly compete with the love they already feel for themselves.
I loved it.
""
"The farcical elements are much too loaded to provide any real fun, and the Stones come off more as sanctimonious, politically correct left-wing prigs than enchanting."
"The movie feels a lot like slacker brother Ben: a little sloppy, mostly predictable, some flashes of poignancy and wisdom, but ultimately doesn't live up to its potential."
"What's so refreshing about Thomas Bezucha's The Family Stone is how it plays off of genre expectations and effortlessly switches back and forth between comedy, romance and tragedy."
"Tocante sem ser melodramático, desenvolve bem seus personagens, cujas interações soam sempre reais. Além disso, o filme oscila com segurança entre o drama e a comédia e conta com um elenco formidável."
...turns from endearing to phony even before the first carol is sung.
.
"Una comedia dramática absolutamente menor, con personajes potencialmente atractivos pero finalmente inverosímiles y estereotipados."
"The Family Stone is a movie for everyone, especially during the holidays."
"Thomas Bezucha who wrote and directed wanted it to build up to a romantic and madcap third act, perhaps a bit like MOONSTRUCK, but somehow it seems forced."
"Direction, acting, and even the dialogue are strong -- absolutely top notch. They are the work of professionals. It's the story line that bottlenecks the whole process."
"This film is clearly a vehicle for Parker. We wouldn't want to waste all the ""Sex and the City"" steam now would we?"
"I can't deny the incidental pleasures of watching these talented players giving it their all, even in such a misguided project."
A miserable misfire that might explain why so many people take their own lives during the holidays.
"The Stone's cruelty is a delight, especially when it turns out Parker actually is a giant loser."
"Like most family holiday gatherings, [it's] awkward and a bit loud in places, but filled with good humor and packed with familiar faces who give you a warm cozy feeling all over."
Rings true in both a comedic and dramatic sense.
...hits upon a couple of sad truths.
"In a time when even movie reviews are quick to qualify everything by perceived left or right leanings, The Family Stone's critique of those who conform their values to political dogma has pertinence."
"Go ahead--throw the first stone. Throw it right at the screen. Take aim, wind up and let the rocks rip."
The third act is marred by a moment of triteness that is uncharacteristic of the delicious and subtle complexity of the rest of the movie. Not your standard holiday family drivel!
"The romantic realignments, which come later in the film, become transparent almost immediately."
"Showered with such gifts as McAdams and Danes, Bezucha surprisingly squeezes precious few laughs out of his syrupy yuletide cider."
"A wildly uneven, poorly-written film without much entertainment value."
This is wonderful; it has heart and humor.
Let's just call it Meet the Stepmom for the Holidays and be done with it.
"One of those films that succeeds not because it surprises you, but because it does what you want it to do -- and it does so pretty well."
"So determined to pair everyone up, whether logically or not, you'd think Noah's Ark was coming to town"
"Like the character of Meredith, the film's bravado cannot mask a messy soul but should be given respect for showing up and sticking it out."
Nothing like a little poignancy to mask a distasteful Christmas brew. But Rachel McAdams is hot.
"As one of the more likable holiday films to come around in a long time, the comedy The Family Stone will also surprise you with its depth and emotional appeal."
"And here, just in time for the holidays, is a television movie all dressed like a feature film."
"The dark humor is amusing enough to suck you into the film, and the melodramatic conclusion will send you out of the theater with a tear in your eye."
The movie's stock base: pat revelations and cheap manipulations.
"Gleefully irreverent and proudly offbeat in its rhythmic mix of pluckiness and pathos, Bezucha's festive family farce is up front and center."
"One of the things I like about The Family Stone is that the characters seem real. They may have some quirks, but they're realistic quirks, not those devised by an overly clever screenwriter."
"There are just too many damn characters, with the best ones taking a backseat to the dullish love quadrangle."
"It feels forcibly formulaic and yet sort of daringly original, all at the same time."
One of those cloying familiar whacky holiday formulaic sitcom drama/comedies that is what it is.
"A terrific screwball comedy in its own right, like a more erudite Meet the Parents."
"Ultra-contrived, but delivers an important message about tolerance."
"Disappointing and ultimately irritating film that fails on several counts, despite a handful of strong performances."
"The delightful Stone family becomes the villain, and we're left unsure whether to crow in triumph when [Meredith] flees or hope she returns with a bazooka and blows the house up. It's this moral ambivalence that makes this thing so interesting."
Just desolately average.
"It's worth two hours for those who appreciate this kind of workmanlike, low-risk drama."
"Richly satisfying, The Family Stone takes us from laughter to tears and back again"
This year's lump of cinematic coal has a diamond blazing inside.
"[The film] at times approximates the cozy hostility that can permeate real-life family gatherings. But then the movie's snap turns to sap, and edgy comedy becomes standard gazing-at-the-Christmas-tree warm fuzziness."
"Some will find it touching, some will be too weary of the plot contrivances and the smug Stone family to care."
"A feel-bad holiday film about a repellent family, with a milquetoast dad and a smug, devious harpy of a mom."
"Strangely, though, it's not an overdose of sentimentality that makes the family - - and the film - - so hard to buy. It's that most of its members are so blithely cruel."
This is one busy wannabe heart-tugger.
Indie director Bezucha has held on to just enough individuality to breathe a little life into the cliches.
The Family Stone is a lot slyer than you might expect.
"There are cringe-worthy passages and an overly sentimental structure (everyone pairs up so very tidily), but the performances are delightful, and the picture comes together."
"Thomas Bezucha applies just the right light touch to the film, layering in strong dollops of wit, wackiness and warmth, making it among the best of its type."
The Family Stone is like a festively wrapped gift box that contains that special sweater you wanted - - only in the wrong size.
"In the spirit of the holiday family saga, I cry, Uncle."
"'The Family Stone' is a cliche-ridden disaster that wants desperately to be a holiday tear-jerker, but mostly pushes all the wrong buttons."
"It doesn't matter how many fine actors are assembled in a film, if the script is terrible, then the movie can't be good."
"In the aggregate, though, it's a fractious Christmas spent with unpleasant relatives you'd rather avoid."
"It's movie comfort food - - a few good laughs, a few winks of recognition, a few tears."
The Family Stone is almost totally emotionally bankrupt.
"The Family Stone is a satisfying, big-hearted celebration of diversity that will brighten holiday moviegoing - - at least in the blue states."
Good acting only goes so far to salvage a bad script.
A machine-tooled entertainment that's as fake and flimsy as a plastic Christmas tree.
An unpalatable slice of leftover holiday turkey ...
"The angry scenes are shattering, the funny scenes are sidesplitting and the sadder scenes dutifully earn their tears."
"The Family Stone should have been a glittering holiday bauble along the lines of the irresistible Love Actually. Instead, Bezucha stuffs into our stockings what he thinks is good for us."
Moments of high hilarity and cringe-inducing honesty are scattered throughout The Family Stone.
"Warm up your belly muscles and grab a box of tissues. When it doesn't have you aching with laughter, The Family Stone will have you sobbing like a little girl."
"It's the kind of warm-hearted, insightful comedy that should become a holiday viewing tradition."
It plays almost like Terms of Endearment crossed with the feel-good yule romance Love Actually.
"So check your disbelief at the door, bring along a mini-packet of Kleenex, and brace yourself for Two-Ply and the Family Stone."
What was supposed to be a jewel turns out to be a simple Christmas trinket.
"The film ping-pongs between wacky comedy and heavy drama, and it is so heavy on plot and character that it takes on a sitcomlike quality."
"When The Family Stone did touch me, I had such mixed feelings, I half-wished the movie had kept its hands to itself."
"Suddenly we're wiping away tears, glancing around to make sure no one noticed we had fallen for this steaming cup of melodrama."
"It's all fairly obvious and manipulative, though it manages to pander no more than average, and does contain a fair bit of wry humor and wit."
The movie is a holiday romantic comedy that wants to put the holiday romantic comedy out of business.
"I don't mind being manipulated as long as it's done well, and writer/director Thomas Bezucha knows how to steer an audience. A great first 'studio' film for Bezucha!"
"Family is a four-letter word in the literate and smartly acerbic Christmas comedic drama The Family Stone, a relationship smorgasbord of acting talent coming together to produce one of the most perceptive holiday features in years."
"Like most of these family get-together films, it's not quirky enough to be interesting or amusing enough to be funny. The drama sometimes weighs as much as mom's fruitcake."
"Rarely have I seen such a maudlin, manipulative, mean-spirited mess masquerading as a holiday comedy."
The Family Stone could have been worse. This dysfunctional family 'comedy' could have been directed by critic's darling Wes Anderson...
"Relax, I’m From the Future fares best in its appealing, oddball opening stretch..."
"A quickly paced slice of silly speculative fiction buoyed by the energetically off-kilter comedy stylings of Rhys Darby. He’s an edgy Mork from Ork, an otherworldly being, charmingly childlike but not above doing the drugs Holly offers him."
"Not so much a sci-fi story as an absurdist’s approach to the whole paradoxical nature of the concept of time travel. It’s a film that gives us permission to say, ‘To hell with it all’ and just accept the story instead of dwelling on it. "
"By the time the film drags to its conclusion, the frenetic anything-goes energy of its first act is long forgotten and the only way to get that good feeling back is to travel back to the beginning.
"
"It's a madcap farce that spirals increasingly out of control, which makes it a lot of fun to watch. And while there are some startlingly serious moments along the way, it never gets very deep."
A sci-fi comedy with a modest sense of humor but tangled message to share with humankind.
"... overloads on quirks and predictable fish-out-of-water gags, and its one-joke premise can’t sustain its momentum at feature length."
"There's an infectious kind of weirdo energy to Relax, I'm from the Future that quickly wins one over..."
"It’s funny, quotable, and unique while constantly finding new ways to feed off the leads’ performances. Higginson has built upon his original short film into a fleshed-out feature more than worth a watch to fans of sci-fi comedies."
"There’s star Rhys Darby, who brings his natural charm to the endeavor, providing a bright, amusing performance in an effort that’s much better with the actor on the move."
"A harmless, but mostly unfunny, witless and dull sci-fi-comedy."
"There's so much science clutter in the film's convoluted twists on a ""Terminator/City on the Edge of Forever"" plot that several themes and characters get lost in the shuffle."
"Relax, I’m from the Future never quite feels confusing, but it does feel incomplete."
"As an excellent mix of comedy and science fiction, neither overwhelms the other genre, even with the odd friendship paring and doomsday looming."
"Filled with ironic humor, a delicious villain turn from Janine Theriault, and a madcap laissez-faire attitude toward physics, Relax, I’m From The Future remains a gentle and profound project about our present. "
Its absurdist take on the state of the foreseeable end of the world works to balance escapism with an all-too-real story about present day. It’s Terminator by way of the next generation of zany modern anxiety.
[D]oesn’t rewrite the rules of time travel... certainly comes at them with a new angle that is more than enough to keep the audience guessing.
A delightful comedic romp with genuine heart
"Luke Higginson’s feature directorial debut is fascinating and entertaining in equal measure, anchored by a hilarious performance from Rhys Darby."
A rather unorthodox time travel comedy with a heartfelt message buried under its deceptively simple narrative.
